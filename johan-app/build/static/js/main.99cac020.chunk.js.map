His award-winning oeuvre of original compositions, symphonic transcriptions and film score arrangements has garnered him international acclaim and have become permanent fixtures in the repertoire of renowned ensembles throughout the world. His Symphony No. 1&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was awarded the prestigious Sudler Composition Prize and has been recorded by myriad ensembles including The London Symphony Orchestra, The North Netherlands Orchestra, The Nagoya Philharmonic and The Amsterdam Wind Orchestra. His Symphony No. 2&nbsp;<em>The Big Apple,&nbsp;</em>Symphony No. 3<em>&nbsp;Planet Earth,&nbsp;</em>Symphony No. 4&nbsp;<em>Sinfonie der Liede</em><em>r </em>as well as his solo concertos, <em>T-Bone Concerto </em>(trombone),<em> UFO Concerto </em>(euphonium)&nbsp;and <em>Casanova</em> (cello) have been enthusiastically received at many of the world’s finest venues.</p>\n    <p>\n\tBefore devoting his time exclusively to composing and conducting, Johan de Meij enjoyed a successful professional career as a trombone and euphonium player, performing with major orchestras and ensembles in The Netherlands. He is in high demand as a guest conductor and lecturer, frequently invited to speak&nbsp;about and perform his own works. In 2010, he was appointed regular guest conductor of the <strong>Simón Bolívar Youth Wind Orchestra</strong> in Caracas, Venezuela – part of the celebrated Venezuelan educational system <em>El Sistema</em>. He currently maintains posts with both the<strong> New York Wind Symphony</strong> and the <strong>Kyushu Wind Orchestra</strong> in Fukuoka, Japan as their principal guest conductor. Johan is founder and CEO of his own publishing company Amstel Music, established in 1989.</p>\n    <p>\n\tWhen not traveling, Johan divides his time between his Hudson Valley home and Manhattan apartment with his wife and muse Dyan, cats Lenny &amp; Tosca and dog Lucy</p>\n<p>\n\tTo follow Johan's whereabouts, please click <a href=\"/events\">EVENTS</a></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Awards and Prizes:</strong></p>\n    <p>\n\t1989 1<sup>st</sup> Prize at The Sudler International Composition Competition Award for <strong>Symphony no.1 The Lord of the Rings</strong></p> \n    <p>\n\t1995 Honorable Mention International Composition Competition of Corciano - Italy for <strong>Symphony No. 2 The Big Apple</strong></p> \n    <p>\n\t1999 1<sup>st</sup> Prize at The International Composition Competition of Corciano - Italy for <strong>Casanova </strong>(for cello &amp; wind orchestra)</p>\n    <p>\n    2000 1<sup>st</sup> Prize at The Oman International Composition Prize for <strong>The Red Tower</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    2001 The Midwest Clinic International Award - Chicago, Illinois - USA\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    2006 2<sup>nd</sup> Prize at The International Composition Competition of Corciano - Italy for <strong>Symphony No. 3 Planet Earth</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n\t2007 Dutch Wind Music Award/Prijs Nederlandse Blaasmuziek</p>\n<p>\n\t2009 Friends of the WMC Award - Kerkrade, The Netherlands</p>\n<p>\n\t2016 2<sup>nd</sup> Prize at The International Composition Competition of Corciano - Italy for <strong>Echoes of San Marco</strong></p>\n    <p>\n\t2016 1<sup>st</sup> Prize at The 6th International Composition Contest City of Muro - Spain for <strong>Fifty Shades of E</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t2017 Buma Classical Award - The Netherlands</p>\n<p>\n\t2017 Nominated for the Vermeulen Prize 2017 for <strong>FELLINI</strong> (Omaggio a Federico Fellini)</p>\n<p>\n\t2017 Finalist for the WASBE Composition Contest with <strong>African Harmony</strong> (Songs from Mama Africa)</p>\n<p>\n\t2018 Midwest Clinic Legend Award for Lifetime Contributions to Music Education - Chicago, Illinois - USA</p>\n<p>\n\t2019 Nominated for the Vermeulen Prize 2019 for <strong>Symphony No. 5 Return to Middle Earth</strong></p>\n        </Col>\n         \n        </Row>\n    </Container>\n    </section>\n    </>)\n}\nexport default Biography","import React from \"react\"\nimport {Row,Col,Container} from \"react-bootstrap\"\nconst SorenHyldgaard = () => {\n    return (<>\n    <section className=\"soren\">\n        <Container>\n            <Row>\n                <Col lg={{span:3}}>\n                    <div>\n                        <img src={`/images/sh6.jpeg`} style={{width:\"100%\",backgrounSize:\"cover\",backgroundPosition:\"50% 10%\",marginBottom:\"25px\"}} alt=\"biogrophy\"/>\n                    </div>\n                    <div>\n                        <img src={`/images/sh8.jpeg`} style={{width:\"100%\",backgrounSize:\"cover\",backgroundPosition:\"50% 10%\"}} alt=\"biogrophy\"/>\n                    </div>\n                </Col>\n                <Col  lg={{span:9}}>\n                <p>Versatility is the keyword in describing the prolific musical talents of Søren Hyldgaard (born August 6th, 1962 in Copenhagen, Denmark). He is wearing at least three hats and seems just as comfortable juggling the nuts-and-bolt challenges of composing the seminal epic film score as he is writing for the concert hall - namely symphonic, chamber, concert bands and brass ensembles. After successes like the Hans Christian Andersen Suite and his Rapsodia Borealis for trombone and wind orchestra (also available for symphony orchestra), Søren continues his ties with Amstel Music with a new, major composition in 2012. \n\n</p><p>Despite his impressive and diverse output, Søren Hyldgaard is basically self-taught in music. A fact that most likely has conveyed the composer's liberal and versatile attitude towards the many styles and genres in contemporary music. As a composer of meditational ‘New Age' music, Søren has published a string of albums with the Scandinavian label Fønix Musik. With more than 125,000 copies sold, he has earned both Silver, Platinum and Double Discs for his classic new age album, ‘Flying Dreams'.\n\n</p><p>Søren Hyldgaard also has received a prestigious artistic acknowledgement award for his achievements in film scoring, presented to him by The San Diego Film Commission in Southern California. Hyldgaard has several European film award nominations to his name, including the Finnish National Film Academy's JUSSI Award as well as the Danish equivalent, the ‘Robert' Award. He won the Danish Film Academy's statuette for his moody film score for ‘Den eneste Ene' (‘The One and Only').\nHis films include the Oscar-nominated short ‘Når livet går sin vej' (1997). He got his Hollywood-debut with the thriller ‘Red' (2008), starring Brian Cox.\n</p><p>\nSøren's personal website:\n<a href=\"http://www.sorenhyldgaard.com\">www.sorenhyldgaard.com</a>\n</p><p>\nFilmography\n</p><ul>\n<li>Adam Hart i Sahara (1990)</li>\n<li>Enken (1990</li>\n<li>The Chaplin Puzzle (1992)</li>\n<li>Den sidste færge (1993)</li>\n<li>Mørkets øy (1997)</li>\n<li>Når livet går sin vej (1997)</li>\n<li>Ørnens øje (1997)</li>\n<li>Poika ja ilves (1998)</li>\n<li>Nattens engel (1998)</li>\n<li>Den eneste ene (1999)</li>\n<li>The Other Side (1999)</li>\n<li>Pyrus på pletten (2000)</li>\n<li>Hjælp, jeg er en fisk (2000)</li>\n<li>Edderkoppen (2000)</li>\n<li>Olsen Banden Junior (2001)</li>\n<li>Bertram &amp; Co (2002)</li>\n<li>Ulvepigen Tinke (2002)</li>\n<li>One Hell of a Christmas (2002)</li>\n<li>Till Eulenspiegel (2003)</li>\n<li>Dogville Confessions (2003)</li>\n<li>Midsommer (2003)</li>\n<li>American Short (2004)</li>\n<li>Fakiren fra Bilbao (2004)</li>\n<li>Forsvar (TV Series) (2004)</li>\n<li>Nynne (2005)</li>\n<li>Red (2008)</li>\n<li>Ses (2008)</li>\n<li>Den fremmede / The Stranger (2009)</li>\n<li>Superbror (2009)</li>\n</ul>\n                </Col>\n            </Row>\n        </Container>\n    </section>\n    </>)\n}\nexport default SorenHyldgaard","import React,{useEffect} from \"react\"\nimport { connect } from \"react-redux\";\nimport { bindActionCreators } from \"redux\";\nimport { mainAction } from 'redux/actions/index.actions'\nimport { ACTIONS } from \"redux/actions/types\"\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\"\nimport { Col,Row} from \"react-bootstrap\"\nconst Cds = (props) => {\n    useEffect(() => {\n        window.scrollTo(0,0)\n       props.actions.mainAction(ACTIONS.
