Its origin goes back to the sixteenth century. The Yiddish culture was at its peak in the countries where the Jews then lived: Poland, Ukraine, Byelorussia (White Russia), Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary.<br /><br />The Yiddish word<em> klezmer</em> (plural: <em>klezmorim</em>) stands for musician (after the Hebrew &ldquo;<em>kele zemer,</em>&rdquo; which means instrument of the song). It is connected with the professional Jewish musicians of Eastern European origin who played this music. Since the 1970s, when America started a revival of this music, the word has been used for the music style itself. Johan de Meij arranged five classics from the klezmer repertoire into a colorful selection:<br /><br /><strong>1. Mazltov</strong><br />In times past, this melody was used for the farewell as a so-called <em>dobranots </em>(&ldquo;good night song&rdquo;) to escort the guests on their leave-taking at a wedding party.<br /><br /><strong>2. Dem Trisker rebn&rsquo;s nign</strong> (The Melody of the Rabbi of Trisk)<br />This melody was first recorded in 1925 in New York by the clarinetist Dave Tarras. The title (Trisk is a town in the Ukrainian province of Volhynia) responded to the sentiments of the many Jewish immigrants who had settled in America. They formed a potential market for the upcoming record industry.<br /><br /><strong>3. Lomir zich iberbetn</strong> (Yiddish: Let Us Reconcile)<br />This is a traditional wedding dance. It is performed at the party by unmarried girls and boys who, to avoid physical contact, were only connected by a handkerchief that they held at the tips, high up in the air.<br /><br /><strong> 4. Chosidl</strong><br />This is a Chassidic dance with a solemn mood. The melody is based on a <em>nigun </em>(Chassidic melody without words). <em>Chassidism</em> is an orthodox movement within the religious Judaism, in which mysticism plays an important role.<br /><br /><strong>5. Ma yofus</strong> (Hebrew: How Beautiful&hellip;)<br />This is a melody based on an ode to the Sabbath. It is a true classic from the klezmer repertoire, and it is also known as <em>Tants, tants, Yidelech</em>. In former days in Eastern Europe, Ma yofus was just as well known as<em> Hava Nagila</em> is today.<br /><br />Marcel Salomon</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Instrumenation:</span></span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">1.

    "synopsis": "<p>The Catskill Mountains is a beautifully preserved region in Upstate New York, flanked to the east by the Hudson River. From the moment my wife and I settled in 2008 in Saugerties, a quaint Hudson Valley town 100 miles north of Manhattan, I started immersing myself into the area&#39;s rich musical history. Discovering a fascinating mix of American, Irish and Scottish folk music, ultimately, it was not easy to choose from such abundance. I ended up using the following six songs:</p><p>* <em>The Foggy</em><em> Dew</em> - is of Irish origin, but was adopted with another text into the local folk song repertoire;<br />* <em>Last</em><em> Winter was a Hard One</em> - tells the story of two Irish immigrant women who complain that their husbands can not find work, and that &lsquo;Those Italians&rsquo; steal their jobs;<br />* <em>A Poor and Foreign Stranger </em>- a gorgeous, heart-breaking ballad;<br />* <em>The Bluestone Quarries </em>- describes the hard work in the nineteenth-century stone quarries. This song is very similar to <em>When </em><em>Johnny Comes Marching Home;</em><br />* <em>The Arkansas</em><em> Traveler </em>- made famous by folk singer Pete Seeger <em>(</em><em>If I Had a Hammer) </em>The music makes a side trip to <em>The Old</em><em> Tobacco Box</em> before coming to a festive conclusion.</p><p><em>Songs from the</em><em> Catskills</em> was commissioned by Concordia College (Moorhead, MN) and Scott A. Jones, Director of Bands, for its 2011 Honor Band Weekend. In April 2011, the work was premiered during this event, conducted by the composer.<br />The work is dedicated to Marilyn and Travis Rothlein, our dear friends and neighbors in the Catskills.</p><p>Johan de Meij<br />Saugerties, NY</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It also served as the test piece for the 3<sup>rd</sup> division of the Swiss National Championships 2011 in Montreux, Switzerland.<br />Unlike most of my compositions, <strong>Sinfonietta No. 1</strong> is an abstract, non-programmatic work. It consists of three movements, in which the thematic material of the opening measures &ndash; an upward fifth jump &ndash; returns in various shapes and forms throughout the piece. The slow middle section features solo passages by E-flat tuba, flugelhorn and euphonium, all starting with the same fifth jump. The final movement presents an Elgar-like march theme, interspersed with quotes from the second movement, and ending with the opening theme of movement I.</p><p>Johan de Meij</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The composition CASANOVA is a musical portrait of Giacomo Casanova who lived from 1725 to 1798. This illustrious character, represented by the violoncello, takes shape by means of eight musical scenes. The events concentrate on some of the most striking episodes from Casanova&rsquo;s adventurous life: his arrest, his captivity and his escape from the ill-famed Piombi prison in Venice. By composing this work, two of my long-lived dreams came true. First of all, I wanted to write a musical homage to one of my favourite composers, Giacomo Puccini. Secondly, for many years I have had the intention to compose a substantial work for violoncello and winds.<br /><br />CASANOVA was commissioned by the Dutch Music Foundation &laquo; Fonds voor de Scheppende Toonkunst &raquo; at the request of the symphonic band &laquo; Sint Micha&euml;l &raquo; of Thorn and it is dedicated to the band&rsquo;s conductor Heinz Friesen.<br /><br />Soloist Roeland Duijne gave the official world premiere performance on 2 April 2000 at the Vredenburg Concert Hall in Utrecht. In August 1999, CASANOVA was awarded the First Prize at the Corciano International Composition Contest in Italy. Johan de Meij Amsterdam, April 2000.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Background information about CASANOVA</strong><br />CASANOVA is a musical tribute to the great Italian opera composer Giacomo Puccini. I have always wondered why Puccini never considered writing an opera based on the adventurous life of his fellow countryman. It appears that Puccini&rsquo;s favourite themes such as love, passion, intrigue and treason are to be found everywhere in Casanova&rsquo;s memoirs. Even so far as their private lives are concerned, many striking similarities are found: Puccini&rsquo;s life consisted of a succession of romances and passionate love affairs, though they do not really match the extravagant adventures of our charming Venetian hero. However, it would be totally unfair to describe Casanova as a mere incorrigible womaniser. His voluminous memoirs, entitled &laquo; History of my life &raquo; clearly demonstrate that he was a quite intelligent and versatile personality, who was a welcome guest of the Italian aristocracy as well as at several European courts. He held several career positions and had many different avocations; at one or other time he was a diplomat, a faith healer, director of the first French Lottery and even probably a spy. He spent the last years of his life writing the already mentioned memoirs and, thanks to his incredible memory, he was able to remember even the smallest details.<br /><br />In-depth study and diligent investigations in dusty archives (a/o. those of J. Rives Childs, the Casanova authority par excellence) revealed that - except for some chronological mistakes - Casanova had given a truthful and clear report of his thrilling adventures and of the tempestuous era in which he lived.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Short musical explanation of the eight scenes.</strong><br />(N.B. The numbers between brackets correspond to the measures in the score).<br /><br /><strong>I . Prologo: Il Tema di Messer Grande (Prologue - the Messer Grande theme)</strong><br />Three powerful minor chords with the brass (b flat, a flat and e minor) build the so-called &ldquo;Messer Grande theme&rdquo;. Chief of Police Messer Grande was at the service of the Venetian Inquisition and was placed in charge of Casanova&rsquo;s arrest. This arrest was due to some intrigues and vague accusations about our hero&rsquo;s so-called &laquo; wicked and libertine way of life &raquo;. There is a great similarity between Messer Grande and Scarpia, the cruel chief of police in Puccini&rsquo;s opera &laquo; Tosca &raquo;, so the musical thematical similarities are not a mere coincidence. Just like Scarpia or Javert (a character from &laquo; Les Mis&eacute;rables &raquo;), Messer Grande is the bad guy and his musical theme immediately supplies the necessary dramatic tension. The Messer Grande theme changes into the Passion theme (m. 18) with the minor ninth chords that are so typical for Puccini.<br /><br /><strong>II. Cadenza - Atto di Presentazione (Cadenza: Casanova presents himself)</strong><br />Casanova comes to the fore (m. 47) in a solo cadenza for violoncello, the latter constantly being surrounded by varying instrumental combinations. The ardent and seducing sound of his voice becomes more and more passionate...<br /><br /><strong>III . La Vita a Corte (Court life) &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The third scene (96) depicts a scene at court: the frivolous setting consists of a magnificent ballroom, complete with chandeliers, sumptuous costumes, an abundance of food and drink... and ... of course, pretty women galore. The violoncello introduces the Casanova theme (pickup into m. 100) which is soon taken over by the complete orchestra.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>IV. L&rsquo;Arresto di Casanova (Casanova&rsquo;s arrest)</strong><br />The music comes to an orchestral climax (173) at which the violoncello is overwhelmed by the complete orchestra: Casanova is arrested and transferred to &laquo; Il Piombi &raquo;, the infamous prison of the Doges&rsquo; Palace. Casanova&rsquo;s despair and indignation is expressed by the violoncello which descends gradually to its lowest register, while being surrounded by some dark Messer Grande chords with the trombones (pickup into 230). The heavy cell door is softly, but irrevocably, closed (237).<br /><br /><strong>V. Reminiscenze (Reveries) &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />For quite some time Casanova lies apathetically on his straw mattress in a pitifully cramped cell. During that first night of captivity he is overwhelmed by gloomy thoughts. A pale ray of daybreak light shines through the prison bars (256). Casanova reflects on his adventurous life, while we hear some street sounds in the background (masked dancers and a mandolin serenade). At the same time, he tries to find a trick that will enable him to escape from this hell as quickly as possible. The lamentations of the monk Marino Balbi, imprisoned in the adjacent cell (bassoon solo, 266) draw Casanova&rsquo;s attention. Both men furtively come into contact, and with Balbi&rsquo;s help, an ingenious escape scenario is elaborated.<br /><br /><strong>VI. L&rsquo;Evasione dai Piombi (Escape from the Piombi prison) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;<br />The roof of the prison is covered with lead plates, which explains its nickname. Several percussion effects suggest the destructive activities that will allow our friends to escape from the Piombi via the roof of the prison. The exciting escape is portrayed by nervous sixteenth note passages for the violoncello, surrounded by recurrent themes and finally giving way to the Passion theme (544).<br /><br /><strong>VII. M.M. e C.C. (M.M. and C.C.) &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />A monastery on the nearby isle of Murano is the setting of the next scene. In this convent Casanova has, for some time, a love affair with two of the nuns. Being tactful, Casanova only mentions his mistresses&rsquo; initials in his memoirs. A sugary tune accompanied by harmonium-like chords played by the clarinets, leads to a climax that turns into the Finale (607) in a very fluent way.<br /><br /><strong>VIII. Finale e Stretto: Il Trionfo dell&rsquo;Amore (Love&rsquo;s triumph) &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />We hear the Passion theme once more, but this time in a triumphant E major key (653) and after a short, melancholic reminiscence of M.M. and C.C. by the soloist (668), a presto vivace leads to the thrilling conclusion.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><font color=\"#000000\">Instrumentation:</font></span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><font color=\"#000000\">Cello solo<br /></font> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Piccolo </span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-variant: normal;\">[doubling 3rd Flute]</span><br /><font color=\"#000000\">2</font> Flutes<br />2 Oboes </span></span></p><div><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">English Horn in F </span></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">2 Clarinets in B flat </span></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Bass Clarinet in B flat<font color=\"#000000\"> </font> <span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-variant: normal;\">[doubling 3rd Bb Clarinet]</span> </span></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><font color=\"#000000\">2 Bassoons<br />Double Bassoon</font><br /></span></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">4 Horns in F </span></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">4 Trumpets in B flat </span></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><font color=\"#000000\">3 Trombones<br />Tuba<br /><br />Timpani<br />Percussion (4 players):</font><br /><font color=\"#000000\">Snare Drum, Bass Drum, Susp.

The success of <em>Riverdance</em> evolved from a concept of music and dance he established earlier with <em>The Seville Suite</em>, his first major orchestral composition. <em>The Seville Suite</em> was commissioned for Ireland&rsquo;s National Day at the World Expo 1992 in Seville, Spain. Through the score, Whelan tells the story of legendary Irish war hero Red Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell. At a mere 21 years of age, O&rsquo;Donnell successfully led a rebellion against the English government in 1593. Although he subsequently joined forces with Spain, he famously suffered defeat in the disastrous battle of Kinsale. The music follows his journey from that infamous battle to his reception with great honors by the Spanish Earl of Cara&ccedil;ena. <em>The Seville Suite</em>received its World Premi&egrave;re at the Maestranza Concert Hall in Seville on October 4, 1992. The wind orchestra version, arranged by Johan de Meij, is a 13-minute adaption with highlights from the original suite.</p><p style=\"margin-left:-9.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BILL WHELAN</strong><br />Bill Whelan has worked extensively in theatre and film.

    "synopsis": "<p><strong>Fifty Shades of E </strong>is a musica lexpedition to discover the myriad nuances of the note E. Throughout the work, the E keeps one foot on centre stage while venturing out through various movements. From its basic tonal functions to when it shimmers under a lyrical guise, the E is seen, heard and experienced from every aural angle.&nbsp;After a short, mysterious introduction in the low brass and percussion, a straightforward unison chorale melody is played by the entire ensemble (measure 11). This thematic subject will only emerge fully at the end of the work (m. 355). The subsequent fugue on the chorale theme begins in the bass register (m. 25), and gradually soars via superimposed fifths within the whole orchestra. At the same time, the tonal idiom becomes more and more unruly. The various groups reunite in a massive rhythmic unison (m. 107), which lands in E major. The melodic percussion and piano continue by playfully engaging the E, using minimalistic, repeating patterns with skittish, consonant additions (m. 117). The chorale theme soon emerges in four different rhythmic and melodic passages in - successively - trombones, horns, saxophones and clarinets. With deliberation, the rhythmic pattern grinds slowly to a halt. In a free cadenza, six solo woodwinds break the mood by visiting and embellishing the main theme, one after another, from high to low. Before measure 207, the baritone sax lingers on its own: its cadenza forms the bridge to the capricious <em>Allegro agitato</em> (m. 207), interspersed with staccato motions and hammering strikes. After a quasi-Beethovian sequence (m. 307-354) leading to the main theme in a minor key (m. 355), a radiant conclusion follows &ndash; inevitably &ndash; into a sounding unison E over seven octaves.</p><p><strong><em>Fifty Shades of E</em></strong> is the winner of the 1<sup>st</sup>Prize in the 6th International Composition Contest &ldquo;City of Muro 2017&rdquo; (Muro, Alicante &ndash; Spain). The Jury, consisting of Carlo Pirola (Conservatory Giuseppe Verdi - Milan), Voro Garcia (Conservatory of Music - Valencia) and Francisco Jos&eacute; Gallego Martinez (Conservatory Mestre Molins - Quart de Poblet) were unanimous in their decision.</p>",

The work forms the second movement of THE VENETIAN COLLECTION, an orchestral suite in which De Meij gives his musical impressions of four different paintings from the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.<br /><br />THE RED TOWER was commissioned by the Banda Civica di Soncino [Italy]. One of the main towers of the ancient walls that surround the medieval town of Soncino, La rocca sforzesca, has a significant resemblance with the tower on De Chirico&rsquo;s painting. De Meij constructed an exciting and warm-blooded work, based on a simple four-note motif, with lyric solo passages for bassoon, bass clarinet and soprano saxophone in the middle section.<br /><br />The world premiere performance took place on September 23rd, 2000 in Sala Verdi in Milano, played by the Banda Civica di Soncino, conducted by the composer.<br /><br />In November of that same year, THE RED TOWER was awarded 1st Prize in the International Composition Competition of OMAN.<br />The other movements of THE VENETIAN COLLECTION are based on VOICE OF SPACE by Ren&eacute; Magritte, who was a great admirer of De Chirico, MAGIC GARDEN by Paul Klee and EMPIRE OF LIGHT by, again, Ren&eacute; Magritte. All four paintings can be found in the Guggenheim Museum in Venice. Together with other outstanding museums in New-York, Bilbao and Berlin, this collection is part of the Solomon R.

Initially, he wrote the stories about Ratty, Mole, Badger and Toad to read to his visually handicapped son Alistair, but after the publication in book form in 1908, it became a worldwide success. It was later also turned into a film and a television series. What appeals to me most is the friendly, very cosy atmosphere that Grahame has managed to create with his optimistic narrative style full of high spirits, an atmosphere that reminds me of my own carefree youth. It was therefore a great pleasure to set this book to music!</p><p><strong>The four movements successively describe:</strong></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 375px; height: 407px;\"><tbody><tr><td><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><u><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">I.

The painting was made in 1931 and is part of the Peggy Guggenheim collection in Venice. Together with James Ensor, Constant Permeke and Andr&eacute; Delvaux, Magritte is among the most famous Belgian painters of the 20th century.<br /><br />He was an extremely prolific and multifaceted artist, whose catalogue boasts over eleven hundred paintings and seven hundred gouaches. He also designed many commercial posters and illustrated several musical scores. VOICE OF SPACE is the first part of THE VENETIAN COLLECTION, a cycle in which Johan de Meij gives his musical impressions of four different paintings from the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.<br /><br />VOICE OF SPACE has been commissioned by l&rsquo;Orchestre d&rsquo;Harmonie de Strasbourg [France] on the occasion of the band&rsquo;s 155th anniversary. The world premiere took place on March 5th, 2000 at a Gala Concert given by the guest band, The Royal Symphonic Band of the Belgian Air Force, conducted by Alain Crepin. For its anniversary the band commissioned some ten compositions by European composers, among those Ida Gotkovski, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Naulais and Roger Boutry.<br /><br />The second part of THE VENETIAN COLLECTION is subtitled THE RED TOWER [La Torre Rossa], referring to a painting by the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, whom Magritte admired very much. The third part is called MAGIC GARDEN [Zaubergarten] by Paul Klee and the cycle is closed by EMPIRE OF LIGHT [L&rsquo;Empire des Lumi&egrave;res] another painting by Ren&eacute; Magritte. The four paintings are displayed at the Peggy Guggenheim museum in Venice. Together with other outstanding museums in New-York, Bilbao and Berlin, this collection is part of the Solomon R.

I say that if one of your good friends is a tuba player and called Jens Bj&oslash;rn-Larsen, you&rsquo;re really in trouble! Because writing for Jens Bj&oslash;rn-Larsen, you&rsquo;re writing for one the most exquisitely lyrical and technically agile tuba soloists around!<br /><br />Bagatelle was written as an encore for a concert a few years ago in the Tivoli Gardens of Copenhagen. Jens Bj&oslash;rn-Larsen was the soloist that evening, and I simply could not resist this opportunity to write a simple, haunting piece that would bring out the soft and mild-mannered side of Jens&rsquo; talent. Often playing in the alto register, he nearly makes the rotund tuba sing with an ethereal quality, not unlike a French horn playing lontano.<br /><br />When my publisher cast his eyes on this piece it was suggested that it also be made available for euphonium and tenor trombone. First of all, there are not many performers like Jens Bj&oslash;rn-Larsen, and there is a dire need for new, soloistic music for the solo euphonium and solo trombone.<br /><br />So here it is. I hope you will enjoy it, even if it is a Bagatelle!<br /><br />S&Oslash;REN HYLDGAARD<br />Copenhagen, Summer 2002</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

    "synopsis": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12px;\">When I take on a commission to write something new, the creative spark usually comes easy enough. Sitting down and putting those tiny dots on paper doesn&rsquo;t come difficult either. It is the interval between those two phases that most often takes up considerable time!<br /><br />The ignition to write a concert piece for the trombone&nbsp; happened in Copenhagen at the Tivoli Gardens concert hall in 1997. Attending rehearsals of my <em>Hans Christian Andersen Suite for Wind Orchestra</em>, I happened to be around for the rehearsal of Johan de Meij&rsquo;s inspiring <em>T-Bone Concerto </em>performed by the phenomenal Jesper Juul S&oslash;rensen. I was particularly struck by the merging of technical virtuosity and lyrical expression &ndash; and, first and last, how completely easy and effortlessly Jesper made it sound. He liked the flavour of my HCA Suite and invited me to compose a concert piece with him in mind. And here we are, some four years and many oeuvres later.<br /><br />With <em>Rapsodia Borealis</em> I had in mind a sort of circular structure centred around a truly lyrical, cantabile theme &ndash; a song of the North for the trombone (hence the title which means Rhapsody of the North). The orchestra is launched at full force but the soloist soon jumps on the carousel of semi-dissonant, kaleidoscopic and nearly minimalist chord progressions. Following a series of playful inventions, the trombone almost surprisingly takes the lead with its tuneful hymn, later to be joined by members of the orchestra in various permutations and arrangements. From the very start, the purpose of this concerto has not necessarily been to re-define the term<em> technically challenging</em> in context with the solo trombone; rather, it was as much my goal to emphasize the tender, lyrical side of the modern concert trombone.<br /><br />S&oslash;ren Hyldgaard<br />Copenhagen - October 2001</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

    "synopsis": "<p><em><strong>1. Introduction: The Noble Poet</strong></em><br />[Fanfare &amp; Hans Christian Andersen Theme]<br />We are introduced to The Poet&rsquo;s Theme; a noble little melody associated with Hans Christian Andersen himself throughout the piece. This work is about the Danish national poet&rsquo;s larger-than-life adventures as much as his beloved fictional stories.</p><p><em><strong>2. The Journeying Storyteller: Europe by Railway</strong></em><br />I: The Train Station.<br />II: Full Steam Ahead!<br />In one of his numerous travelogues, Andersen shares his awe-inspired, almost childish infatuation with the recent wonder of technology - the railway! A man used to bitter blisters and bumpy carriage rides, Hans Christian Andersen clearly saw the steam-engined train as a blessing. This hybrid movement is a free depiction of the writer&rsquo;s enthused notes, carrying you from a local train station through southern Europe and all the way to the exotic landscapes of Near- and Middle East.</p><p><em><strong>3. The Little Match-Girl</strong></em><br />In one of Andersen&rsquo;s saddest and most beloved short stories, a young child on New Year&rsquo;s Eve desperately tries to sell a few bundles of matches. Ignored by the busy citizens, the little girl fantasises about warm lodgings and rich food; in the flare of her matches, she has a vision of her old grandmother in Heaven, which is soon to be welcoming a new soul as the last match fades away...</p><p><em><strong>4. Constantinopel: A Poet&rsquo;s Bazar</strong></em><br />&ldquo;A Poet&rsquo;s Bazar&rdquo; is one of Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s most contagiously uplifting books. In short, his portrayal of the marketplaces of Constantinopel (now known as Istanbul) is one of great romanticism and poetry - and very little realism. Like a child in a candy store, Andersen describes the smells of exotic teas, incense, and spices. Thus, rather than staying anywhere near loyal to indigenous Middle-East harmony, I wrote this lively piece more in tradition with theatrical &lsquo;Hollywood&rsquo; conventions, airing on the way more than one clich&eacute;d preconception about Arabian Nights or Persian Markets...</p><p><em><strong>5. Dream Waltz [The Poet and &ldquo;The Swedish Nightingale&rdquo;]</strong></em><br />Much has been written and speculated about the romantic life of Hans Christian Andersen; little derives from his own log-keeping, but his obsession with famous soprano Jenny Lind is undeniable. A true mega-star in her own time, Ms. Lind was affectionately referred to as &lsquo;The Swedish Nightingale&rsquo; and lent her title as a primary inspiration for Andersen&rsquo;s Chinese fairytale. The poet regarded himself clumsy and not at all a ladies&rsquo; man; I could not help visualising the poet and his singer of dreams in a grand ball-room, him trying to lead his belle but invariably stepping over his own big feet in what becomes more of a nightmare. Hence, I hope you will find yourself in a sort of musical maze here - always looking to put the right foot down at the right beat and frantically searching for romantic grace and harmony. Have you ever waltzed in 7/8 time?</p><p><em><strong>6. The Tinder-Box</strong></em><br />I: The Soldier&rsquo;s March<br />II: The Old Witch; The Giant Dogs &ldquo;With Eyes Big As The Round-Tower&rdquo;<br />III: Hex Beheaded!<br />A Danish rendition of the story of Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp, Andersen lit up the hearts of his fellow-Danes with his Tinder-Box, the story of a cheerful soldier tricked by a mean old witch to descend into a hollow tree and retrieve her old Zippo. The soldier charms his way past the three mean watchdogs but eventually decides there must be something to that old tinderbox - and bluntly chops of the witch&rsquo;s ugly head! This is only the opening of a wild romp of a tale. But why tell the rest of such a well known story? - If you don&rsquo;t know the ending - GO READ IT!</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />[Edited by Johan de Meij]<br />1. Piccolo<br />4.

While extremely challenging on the timing and hitting-the-action side, the furious universe of the animated adventure genre is as much an inspiration as it is an obstacle. The very character of Till, Europe&rsquo;s mythical prankster with well over 800 years of accumulated fame to his credit, calls for over-the-top and minutely timed, &lsquo;mickey-moused&rsquo; action music.<br /><br />Focusing first on Till&rsquo;s Theme and later King Rupert&rsquo;s theme, The King&rsquo;s March from Till Eulenspiegel captures the high spirits of the film itself. The town of Boomstadt is expecting a royal visit, but Till has convinced the eight year old King to let Till himself appear as the young monarch to protect him from evil plotting. And thus, the royal carriage and the extravagant entourage arrive in Boomstadt -- with all the Pomp and Circumstance...</p><p>S&oslash;ren Hyldgaard, March 2004</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

    "synopsis": "<p>Before the composing of this piece, Surround Sound used to be a concept confined to movies or home theatre viewing. When sitting in the cinema hall some of the sound effects, and some times indeed even the music, seems to be coming from behind your back or traveling over your head &mdash; that&rsquo;s surround sound.<br /><br />When I was approached to compose a short, efficacious fanfare in the event of the inauguration of a large, high profile cultural center in the city of Lyngby outside Copenhagen, I was inspired by the fact that a state-of-the-art, 11-theatre complex constituted a considerable part of the Cultural House. Why not write a musical piece in &ldquo;Surround Sound&rdquo;? It turned out that the concert hall was ideally suited for the purpose. Behind the audience is a balcony, most likely built for lights and sound mixing &mdash; a perfect stand for a couple of musicians serving as &lsquo;surround performers&rsquo; in conjunction with the orchestra on the main stage.<br /><br />Thus, Surround Sound is a composition meant to be experienced live rather than merely listened to. The audience will feel the drum rolls and trumpet signals flying across the hall like a ball being tossed back and forth. Heads up!<br /><br /><strong>Performance Suggestions</strong>:<br />In order to obtain the &lsquo;Surround Sound&rsquo; intended for this composition, the following off-stage directions should ideally be followed and if necessary adjusted to fit the settings of the concert hall in question:<br />* One cornet/trumpet player and one percussionist, playing the snare drum, perform from a balcony or in a hall corridor behind the audience. Alternatively, the performer will be standing in the aisle of the extreme back row<br />* One cornet/trumpet player performs from a backstage position (or at the side of the stage)<br /><br />The opening section of Surround Sound is to be performed on the basis of the players knowing the offset tempo by heart; however, the conductor should be cueing the on-stage bass drum &amp; cymbals. The most effective &ldquo;surround sound&rdquo; gimmick is accomplished by minutely obeying and almost exaggerating the crescendo - decrescendo nuances &lsquo;cross fading&rsquo; between the two ends of the concert hall.<br /><br />S&oslash;ren Hyldgaard</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br /><em>for Symphonic Band</em><br />1.

    "synopsis": "<p>The TIVOLI FESTIVAL OVERTURE could be seen as a not-so-distant cousin to S&oslash;ren Hyldgaard&rsquo;s HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN SUITE; the famed Tivoli Gardens in central Copenhagen served as an inspirational source to the composer as much as it did to Andersen. The immortal poet was among the celebrities who attended the opening of &ldquo;Carstensen&rsquo;s Garden&rdquo;, as Tivoli was initially called when it opened its gates in 1843.<br /><br />&lsquo;The Strauss of the North&rsquo; was a nickname given to Hans Christian Lumbye, Tivoli&rsquo;s first maestro and Head of Music - and a musical icon in Golden Age popular music in Scandinavia. S&oslash;ren Hyldgaard&rsquo;s TIVOLI FESTIVAL OVERTURE is as much a tribute to Lumbye and his lilting and always tuneful pieces written for Tivoli. Hence, noticable mostly to Danes and regular Tivoli visitors with a keen ear for music, S&otilde;ren has included tiny glimpses of Lumbye&rsquo;s Champagne Galop and Pictures of a Dream - but carefully wrapped in his own melodic creations. However, the first soothing bars actually cites the Copenhagen Town-Hall bells, the tune of which is heard every hour by all Tivoli Gardens visitors.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />[Edited by Johan de Meij]<br />1.

This was the first time I became acquainted with the vuvuzela, the infamous plastic trumpet that was constantly and massively blaring during the games. At first I felt the sound was irritating, and I would even turn the volume down. But eventually I became fascinated by the idea of incorporating that haunting B-flat into the piece. To me, the vuvuzela came to represent the voice of the common man and the power of all wind instruments.</p>",

When her aunt visits her, she tells Angelica about her baby son &ndash; whom she saw and kissed only once before she was sent to the convent. What does he look like? What color are his eyes? She then hears that her child died two years ago. This terrible news becomes the reason for her only aria, Senza Mamma, a heart-rending song of restraint and dignity to her little &lsquo;angel in heaven&rsquo; (Angelo del Cielo).

    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p><em>Extreme Make-over </em>consists of a number of musical metamorphoses on a theme from Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s well-known <em>Andante cantabile</em> (the second movement of his String Quartet No. 1 in D, Op. 11, written in 1871). &ldquo;Never in my life have I felt so flattered, never have I been so proud of my creative powers as when Lev Tolstoy sat in the chair next to mine listening to my <em>Andante</em>, and the tears ran down his cheeks,&rdquo; wrote the composer in the winter of 1876 on the occasion of a special concert organised for Tolstoy at the Moscow Conservatory. In 1888 Tchaikovsky arranged this movement for cello and orchestra.<br /><br />The main theme of the<em> Andante cantabile</em> is based on a Russian folksong. In <em>Extreme Make-over</em> this theme is introduced in its original form by a brass quartet consisting of two cornets, alto horn and euphonium. At the theme&rsquo;s reprise, muted cornets sneak, almost inaudibly, alongside the four soloists and elongate each note of the melody, as though the sustaining pedal on a piano has been depressed. The first metamorphosis emanates from a single tone, to which the two successive tones from the theme are added in bell-like chords. The addition of the lower second results in a completely new sound world, completing the first metamorphosis. Anticipating the canonic theme from the finale, a timpani solo forms the transition to the <em>Alla marcia</em>. This movement is composed in a robust neo-classical style and is peppered with quotes, including fragments from Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s Fourth and Sixth Symphonies and the Fantasy-Overture <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>.<br /><br />The following movement features a rather unconventional instrumental group: ten tuned bottles, played by members of the cornet section. This group eventually provides the accompaniment for an extensive marimba solo, gradually producing a sort of gamelan effect. In composing for the tuned bottles I have applied the &lsquo;hoketus&rsquo; technique: each player produces a single note of the melody or the chord.<br /><br />This fragile movement is joined seamlessly to the finale, a canonic treatment of the theme.

    "subTitle": "",
    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "symphony orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p>Johan de Meij&rsquo;s first symphony &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo; is based on the trilogy of that name by J.R.R. Tolkien. This book has fascinated many millions of readers since its publication in 1955. The symphony consists of five separate movements, each illustrating a personage or an important episode from the book.<br /><br /><strong>The movements are:</strong><br />I. GANDALF (The Wizard)<br />II. LOTHLORIEN (The Elvenwood)<br />III. GOLLUM (Sm&eacute;agol)<br />IV. JOURNEY IN THE DARK<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The Mines of Moria<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The Bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m<br />V. HOBBITS<br /><br />The symphony was written in the period between March 1984 and December 1987, and had its premi&egrave;re in Brussels on 15th March 1988, performed by the &ldquo;Groot Harmonieorkest van de Gidsen&rdquo; under the baton of Norbert Nozy. In 1989, The Symphony The Lord of the Rings was awarded a first prize in the Sudler International Wind Band Composition Competition in Chicago, and a year later, the symphony was awarded by the Dutch Composers Fund. In 2001, the orchestral version was premiered by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />Although it is not simple to summarize such an extensive and complex work, the main outline is als follows: the central theme is the Ring, made by primaeval forces that decide the safety or destruction of the World. For years it was the possesion of the creature Gollum, but when the Ring falls into the hands of the Hobbits the evil forces awake and the struggle for the Ring commences. There is but one solution to save the World from disaster: the Ring must be destroyed by the fire in which it was forged: Mount Doom in the heart of Mordor, the country of the evil Lord Sauron.</p><p>It is the Hobbit Frodo who is assigned to carry out this task, and to assist him a company, the Fellowship of the Ring, is formed under the leadership of Gandalf, the wizard, which includes the Hobbits Sam, Peregrin and Merin, the Dwarf Gimli, the Elf Legolas, Boromir and Aragorn, the later King. The Companions are secretly followed by Gollum, who does not shun any means, however perfidious, to recover his priceless Ring. However, the Companions soon fall apart, after many pernicious adventures and a surprising d&eacute;nouement Frodo and Sam can at last return to their familiar home, The Shire.<br /><br />Explanation of the five movements:<br /><br /><strong>I. GANDALF (The Wizard)</strong><br />The first movement is a musical portrait of the wizard Gandalf, one of the principal characters of the trilogy. His wise and noble personality is expressed by a stately motiff which is used in a different form in movements IV and V. The sudden opening of the Allegro vivace is indicative of the unpredictability of the grey wizard, followed by a wild ride on his beautiful horse &ldquo;Shadowfax&rdquo;.<br /><br /><strong>II. LOTHLORIEN (The Elvenwood)</strong><br />The second movement is an impression of Lothl&oacute;rien, the elvenwood with its beautiful trees, plants, exotic birds, expressed through woodwind solo&rsquo;s. The meeting of the Hobbit Frodo with the Lady Galadriel is embodied in a charming Allegretto; in the Mirror of Galadriel, a silver basin in the wood, Frodo glimpses three visions, the last of which, a large ominous Eye, greatly upsets him.<br /><br /><strong>III. GOLLUM (Sm&eacute;agol)</strong><br />The third movement describes the monstrous creature&nbsp; Gollum,&nbsp; a slimy,&nbsp; shy&nbsp; being&nbsp; represented&nbsp; by&nbsp; the soprano saxophone. It mumbles and talks to itself, hisses and lisps, whines and snickers, is alternately pitiful and malicious, is continually fleeing and looking for his cherished treasure, the Ring.<br /><br /><strong>IV. JOURNEY IN THE DARK</strong><br />The fourth movement describes the laborious journey of the Fellowship of the Ring, headed by the wizard Gandalf, through the dark tunnels of the Mines of Moria. The slow walking cadenza and the fear are clearly audible in the monotonous rhythm of the low brass, piano and percussion. After a wild persuit by hostile creatures, the Orks, Gandalf is engaged in battle with a horrible monster, the Balrog, and crashes from the subterranean bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m in a fathomless abyss. To the melancholy tones of a Marcia fun&egrave;bre, the bewildered Companions trudge on, looking for the only way out of the Mines, the East Gate of Moria.<br /><br /><strong>V. HOBBITS</strong><br />The fifth movement expresses the carefree and optimistic character of the Hobbits in a happy folk dance; the hymn that follows emanates the determination and noblesse of the hobbit folk. The symphony does not end on an exuberant note, but is concluded peacefully and resigned, in keeping with the symbolic mood of the last chapter &ldquo;The Grey Havens&rdquo; in which Frodo and Gandalf sail away in a white ship and disappear slowly beyond the horizon.</p><p>The Amstel Music Rental Catalogue<br />â„… Hal Leonard MGB Distribution BV<br />Attn.

Hurtling through each instrumental group, it leads us to a festive conclusion.</p><p align=\"right\">Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, June 2006</p><p><strong>Performance suggestions</strong></p><p>* The opening movement can be performed without conductor, emphasizing the chamber music aspect of the piece and allowing the four soloists to exhibit their ensemble skills. The conductor can then take over at either measure 33 or measure 51 (<em>Poco pi&ugrave; animato</em>).</p><p>* The preparation and playing of the tuned bottles requires some explanation. Fill the bottles almost to the brim with water and then tune them accurately to the following concert pitches: D, E, G#, A and B over two octaves (in the score these notes are transposed for the B-flat and E-flat instruments). Adding or removing even a few drops can make a considerable difference in the pitch. The precise shape or size of bottle does not matter much, provided the neck of the bottle is not too wide to comfortably produce a sound. Use a cork or a screw top to prevent evaporation (which would affect the pitch) and take a spare prepared bottle on stage in case of accidental spillage. You never know!</p><p>* The method of producing a sound on the bottles is comparable to a flute or pan flute embouchure. A certain amount of practice is required to be able to produce a full, pleasant sound. Over-blowing will result in unwanted overtones. Once the player has established the optimum angle of his embouchure, his sound will resemble a somewhat breathy flute tone. A large dynamic range is possible. For the flutists, this will not be a great problem. The clarinet group may possibly seek some advice from them. To get used to the &lsquo;hoketus&rsquo; structure, at a rehearsal the &lsquo;bottle notes&rsquo; can be played on the usual instruments first.</p><p>* This will all take some getting used to and is usually accompanied by general mirth and the customary raucous jokes. But once the players have mastered the technique and the balance, the result is extraordinary: an entirely new sound emerges from the ensemble. The composer hereby also affords the players a legitimate excuse to empty as many bottles as they see fit, before or after rehearsals. Cheers!</p><p>Johan de Meij</p><p>NB. An extra synthesizer part is added to piano part in the set, to be used only as a substitute for the bottle section, or as a rehearsal aid. JdM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "subTitle": "",
    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "symphony orchestra & female choir",
    "synopsis": "<p>Symphony N&deg; 3 Planet Earth &ndash; Johan de Meij<br />The guideline of my First Symphony The Lord of the Rings was the novel trilogy of the same name, and my Second Symphony The Big Apple was conceived as an ode to the city of New York with its many aspects. Symphony N&deg; 3 is also an ode: this time not devoted to a town or a region, but to the entire world with its fascinating beauty and appearance.<br /><br />The title Planet Earth may remind us of The Planets by Gustav Holst. In that composition the composer deals with all of the planets... except for the Earth. In Planet Earth I continue where Holst has stopped, not only in the figurative sense, but also in the literal. Whereas The Planets concludes with a six-part choir of female voices and a large orchestra, I use a similar strength at the beginning of my first part (entitled Lonely Planet) in the same vein. But that is where the similarity ends. I also borrow some material from my Continental Overture (1995), a composition that was actually a preliminary study for this symphony. In the opening movement we approach the &lsquo;lonely planet&rsquo; by means of a big bang that launches us into the universe. The comets and planets fly about our ears through loudspeakers put on the stage.<br /><br />The sampled sounds become the connection between the three movements. This technique compares with the city sounds used in The Big Apple. In the central movement (Planet Earth) the cosmic noise of the first part is replaced by a pastoral flock of flying birds over the splendid landscapes of our planet. Moreover, this part evokes the concentrated energy and the spirit which life on Earth gives me. In the final part of the symphony (Mother Earth), I use an ode to Mother Earth (Gaia in Greek) which I borrowed from the Old Greek Hymns by Homer, an abstract classical language in which the beauty and vital energy of the earth are praised. The symphony concludes with this cantata in a finale in which I pull out all the stops. All musicians contribute to this ode and conclude the composition in a majestic way: with an endless hymn sung at the top of their voices, the choir sings the original words of Homer from thousands of years ago: &ldquo;I will chant the Earth, mother of all things!&rdquo;<br />Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, November 2006<br /><br />Hymn to Gaia<br />I will sing of well-founded Earth,<br />Mother of all, eldest of all beings.<br /><br />She feeds all creatures that are in the world; all that<br />go upon the goodly land and all that are in the paths<br />of the seas and all that fly; all these are fed of her store.<br /><br />Hail mother of the gods, wife of starry Heaven<br />freely bestow upon me for this my song<br />substance that cheers the heart!<br /><br />Hail mother of the gods, o Gaia!<br />Through you, O queen, men are blessed in their children and blessed<br />in their harvests, and to you it belongs to give means of life to mortal men<br />and to take it away, O Gaia!<br /><br /><br />The Symphony N&deg; 3 Planet Earth has been written at the request of Marcel Mandos, artistic manager of the Noord Nederlands Orkest (NNO, the North Netherlands Symphony Orchestra) and was premiered by the NNO and the North Netherlands Concert Choir conducted by Otto Tausk at the Rotterdam concert hall &ldquo;De Doelen&rdquo; on March 2, 2006. (CD: Amstel Classics 2006-01)<br />Symphony N&deg; 3 Planet Earth was awarded the second prize at the International Composition Competition of Corciano (Italy). It was not the first time Johan de Meij was awarded a prize at this prestigious competition: in 1993 his Symphony N&deg; 2 The Big Apple received an honourable mention and in 1999, De Meij was awarded the first prize with his cello concerto Casanova.</p>",

    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "symphony orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p>My Second Symphony is an ode to New York:&nbsp; not strictly programmatic music but rather a musical interpretation of the spirit, glamour and indifference of one of the most fascinating cities in the world. The first movement, (Skyline) depicts the massive facade, the &lsquo;global&rsquo; contours of New York; in the second movement (Gotham) the brutal, chaotic aspects of the metropolis are introduced. Listening to this symphony is perhaps as enervating as an actual visit to Manhattan.&nbsp; The listener is scarcely granted a moment of calm:&nbsp; even the more subdued passages are invariably accompanied by an obstinate rumbling in the background - the music never really quietens down...<br /><br /><strong>The Big Apple</strong><br />The name The Big Apple was often used during the twenties by jazz musicians:&nbsp; if you managed to play in the New York jazz clubs you had made it, you had the &lsquo;Big Apple&rsquo; in the palm of your hand!&nbsp; Today, however, the bright red apple functions as a symbol of the city:&nbsp; a welcome object in the souvenir shops, where post cards, pencil sharpeners, T-shirts and posters depict in countless variations this trademark of New York. The subtitle of the second movement, Gotham, is another nickname for the city.<br /><br /><strong>Time Square Cadenza</strong><br />My initial plan of writing a three movement symphony with a slow middle movement&nbsp; was soon abandoned since this was not in keeping with the frenetic energy, turmoil and the accelerated pulse beat that I always feel during my visits to the Big Apple.&nbsp; To preserve the tension between the two movements the idea emerged of a non-musical intermezzo: Times Square Cadenza, a compilation of city sounds I personally recorded, which links the two movements of the symphony together into a single uninterrupted whole.<br /><br /><strong>Brief Musical Explanation</strong><br />The musical language running through the entire work is robust, angular and straightforward, unencumbered by depth or philosophical reflection.&nbsp; The symmetry of the New York street map together with the massive architecture of the skyscrapers provided the structure of the thematic material.&nbsp; For me, composing this work was both an exploration of various musical styles as well as a tribute to Aaron Copland, John Adams and Leonard Bernstein.<br />The syncopated, restless interval structure of the first theme on the horns, known as the Skyline Motif, follows the contours of the impressive silhouette of the Big Apple.&nbsp; From this motif all other themes are distilled, such as the extended melodic lines on the English horn, later joined by oboe and piano, and the massive sound blocks played by the brass.&nbsp; The whole is surrounded by repeated accompanying figures on the woodwinds, piano, harp and mallets:&nbsp; a jumble of lights and the on-and-off flicker of neon signs.</p><p>The recurrent use of these repeated sound patterns bears a certain resemblance to minimal music, and there are also rhythmic influences of such musical styles as jazz and ragtime. The addition of a harpsichord is not the most obvious alternative in this context, but it is precisely the rigid, hammering nervous system of this instrument that fits so well into the orchestration.<br /><br />The theme of the second movement is based entirely on the opening motif played by the brass; all possible manifestations of this four-tone motif are then used, in the accompanying figures as well as in the theme itself, including an extended dialogue (or duel?) between the timpani and the roto-toms.&nbsp; Apart from this, the second motif, which begins with an octave jump, provides the remaining musical building blocks.&nbsp; As the symphony concludes, a contrapuntal form of the Skyline Motif returns from the first movement.<br /><br />Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, November 1993<br /><br />Symphony No. 2, The Big Apple was commissioned by The United States Air Force Band in Washington D.C., on the initiative of its commander and conductor, Lieutenant Colonel Alan L. Bonner, and was composed between October 1991 and September 1993.&nbsp; The official premier performance was given in March 1994 during the American Bandmasters Association Convention and the Pacific Basin Music Festival in Honolulu, Hawaii.&nbsp; The Dutch premiere was played by the Amsterdam Wind Orchestra conducted by Heinz Friesen in Muziekcentrum Vredenburg, Utrecht on 20 February 1994.<br /><br />The Big Apple was a finalist at the 14th International Composition Competition in Corciano, Italy (1993) and was awarded an honourable mention.<br /><br />My Second Symphony is dedicated to my parents.</p>",

Going back nearly two decades, each December I spend a couple of days in Chicago to attend the famed Midwest Band &amp; Orchestra Clinic. Besides all the hustle and bustle of that great event, there is always some spare time to go into town. Each year, my fascination for America&rsquo;s 3rd largest city grows. I enjoy the skyline with its dazzling architecture, riding The Loop (Chicago&rsquo;s idiosyncratic subway), shopping on The Magnificent Mile, The Art Institute, fabulous restaurants, a swinging night in a jazz club; I can&rsquo;t get enough.<br /><br />There is, however, one drawback: The Wind&hellip;. When a blast of frigid air blows in from Lake Michigan, it is not fun for a European used to balmier breezes. In a very personal way I understand the aptness of the city&rsquo;s nickname.<br /><br />The title came easy. The result is a short and energetic work, incorporating the spirit and the power of a city that never ceases to fascinate me.<br /><br />Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, May 2006</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>Giacomo Puccini was commissioned to write a second opera after the resounding success of his first, <em>Le Villi</em>. However, the original four-act, grand opera <em>Edgar,</em> to a libretto by Ferdinando Fontana, received a rather lukewarm reception at its premi&egrave;re in La Scala in Milan in 1889 &ndash; initially, the work was only performed three times. Of all the planned performances in the subsequent two years, only one took place, in Lucca, Puccini&rsquo;s birthplace. There, the work was well received. Nevertheless, the composer decided to make drastic changes to <em>Edgar</em> the most radical being the reduction of the opera to three acts, as well as altering a few arias, characters and instrumental parts. In its revised form, the work was even less popular than before. The discarded fourth act later provided material for <em>Tosca</em> (the duet <em>Amoro sol&rsquo; per te</em>), but Puccini never felt the need to defend <em>Edgar</em> &ndash; as he did other less fortunate operas, such as <em>La Rondine</em> and <em>Suor Angelica</em>. On a piano excerpt for his female friend Sybil Seligman he even corrupted the title to &lsquo;E Dio ti GuARda da quest&rsquo; opera&rsquo; (may God preserve you from this opera). This did not prevent Arturo Toscanini performing the <em>Requiem </em>from the third act at Puccini&rsquo;s funeral in Milan Cathedral on 3 December 1924.</p><p>The <em>Requiem</em> in the third act is being played when the long funeral procession carries the alleged body of Edgar &ndash; the confused young man hesitating between the love of the virtuous Fidelia and the exotic Tigrana. The mass hails Edgar as a hero, but a monk claims that he has betrayed his country for a few gold pieces. When the soldiers try to desecrate the body, they discover that the armor contains none. The monk reveals himself as Edgar. He wants to leave with his faithful Fidelia, but the vengeful Tigrana stabs him and kills Fidelia. Edgar grieves over the lifeless body of his beloved, while Tigrana is arrested and the people submerge into prayer.</p><p align=\"right\">Anthony Fiumara</p>",

The contrary is true in Giacomo Puccini&rsquo;s opera <em>Tosca</em>: He turns the Roman basilica Sant&rsquo; Andrea della Valle into a playground for hiding rebels, jealous lovers, sanctimonious fresco painters and invading police officers.</p><p>Church bells are tolling. Intermittently, from the castle of Sant&rsquo; Angelo comes the boom of the cannon. The choir boys and acolytes falsely believe that Napoleon has been defeated. They are there to sing a thankful Te Deum, when Baron Scarpia, the infamous chief of the Roman secret police, arrives with some of his men in search of Angelotti, an escaped prisoner. The painter Cavaradossi, Tosca&rsquo;s lover, has helped the prisoner hide in the chapel. Scarpia soliloquizes vindictively: he exults in his power to send Cavaradossi to execution, while he will bring Tosca into his own arms. For her, he exclaims, he would renounce his hopes of heaven (&quot;Va, Tosca! Nel tuo cuor s&rsquo;annida Scarpia&quot; - Go, Tosca! There is room in your heart for Scarpia). He then kneels and fervently joins in the &quot;Te Deum.&quot;</p><p align=\"right\">Anthony Fiumara</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>Giacomo Puccini composed his first music theatre work, <em>Le Villi, </em>for the 1883 competition of one-act operas, issued by the publisher Sonzogno in the periodical <em>Il Teatro illustrato</em>. Puccini did not even earn an honourable mention with this work, probably because he had written the score in such a great hurry that it was hardly legible.</p><p>For the hugely successful first performance of the work, Puccini received financial support by the librettist Arrigo Boito. Subsequently, the publisher Giulio Ricordi engaged Puccini, which proved to be a profitable move. &nbsp;Ricordi asked the composer to expand the work, so Puccini created a final version in 1892. It premiered in Hamburg the same year &shy;&ndash; by no less a conductor than Gustav Mahler.</p><p>The poet Heinrich Heine once wrote the following about the fairy-like figures called &lsquo;Villi&rsquo; or &lsquo;Wilis&rsquo;: &ldquo;Wilis are betrothed maidens who died before their weddings. These poor creatures cannot find rest in their graves. &nbsp;In their dead hearts, in their dead feet, the passion for dancing lives on.&nbsp; A passion that they could not satisfy in their lifetime. At midnight they appear in groups along country lanes.&nbsp; Woe betide the young man who encounters them! He will be forced to dance with them, and he must dance until he drops dead!&rdquo;</p><p>Puccini wrote two movements for a symphonic intermezzo between the two acts &ndash; <em>L&#39;Abbandono</em> (The Desertion) and <em>La Tregenda</em> (The Witches&rsquo; Sabbath). The main character, Roberto, is bewitched and as a result forgets about his beloved Anna: She waits for the duration of three seasons, and finally dies in Roberto&rsquo;s absence. During the intermezzo, the legend of the &lsquo;Villi&rsquo; is explained: When a woman dies of a broken heart, the fairies force the heartbreaker to dance himself to death.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"right\">Anthony Fiumara</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>The Hymn To My Country is the trio part of the second movement, entitled &lsquo;In the Country&rsquo;, from the third Symphony To My Country (1886 - 1890) by the Dutch composer Bernard Zweers (1854 - 1924). This symphony was written at a time when a lot of composers were largely inspired by patriotic feelings. The compositions of Zweers have apparently been influenced by his contemporaries such as Antonin Dvor&agrave;k, Jean Sibelius (Finlandia), Bedrich Smetana (who also wrote a work entitled &lsquo;My Country&rsquo; (Ma Vlast) - a cycle of symphonic poems including the famous Moldau) and Edvard Grieg.<br /><br />Although his father, a music dealer and amateur musician, at first described his son&rsquo;s musical activities as &lsquo;a waste of paper and time&rsquo;, Zweers did not abandon his vocation. When the 27-year-old Bernard Zweers conducted his first symphony in 1881, his father was so impressed that he allowed his son to devote himself completely to music.<br /><br />The arrangement of this chorale was written on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Liberation of the Netherlands on May 5th, 1995, and is dedicated &lsquo;To My Country&rsquo;.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br /><em>(AM 31 Symphonic Band)</em><br />1.

    "synopsis": "<p>Modeste Moussorgsky (1831-1881) became especially known as a composer of songs and operas with medieval Russian history as a subject. With his opera <em>Boris Godunov</em>, his orchestral work <em>Night on Bald Mountain</em>, and his piano cycle <em>Pictures at an Exhibition</em> he acquired world fame, even though until recently, the versions of the known works by Moussorgsky were mostly completed after he died, and were adapted by colleague-composers. Nowadays the original scores are sparsely available for performances again.<br /><br />In the time of the first presentation of <em>Boris Godunov</em> (an opera that got bad reviews but quickly became very popular with the audience), Moussorgsky began working on his opera-ballet <em>Mlada</em>, a combined project of several great Russian composers: C&eacute;sar Cui, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Alexander Borodin, and Modeste Moussorgsky, all members of the so-called &lsquo;Mighty Handful&rsquo;, and Ludwig Minkus, who would provide the ballet music. Ultimately, the production of <em>Mlada</em> unfortunately fell&nbsp; through, and the collective opera was never performed. Like the other composers, Moussorgsky used material from the opera in other works &ndash; for example <em>Night on Bald Mountain</em>, which was originally meant to be a choir movement for Mlada. In addition, the festive march from <em>Mlada</em> assumed a life of its own after the cancelled project &ndash; in the orchestration by Rimsky-Korsakov, that is &ndash; but up to now has been one of the less-known works by Moussorgsky. Thanks to this arrangement for concert band, this festive opening piece will be heard a bit more often.<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br /><em>for Wind Orchestra [AM 83]</em><br />1.

    "synopsis": "<p>The French composer Darius Milhaud (1892-1974) was a member of the &lsquo;Groupe des Six&rsquo;. This group of six composers gathering Honegger, Poulence, Auric, Durey, Tailleferre and Milhaud, imitated Erik Satie by revolting against the deeply rooted traditional conventions of that time. They reacted against impressionism (Debussy) and romanticism (Wagner, Mahler) and felt very strongly about the music of Satie and Strawinsky.<br /><br />Milhaud&rsquo;s most popular work is undoubtedly the ballet &lsquo;La Cr&eacute;ation du Monde&rsquo;, one of the most striking examples of jazz influences in classical music. The premi&egrave;re at the &lsquo;Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Champs Elys&eacute;es&rsquo; in October 1923 caused a real scandal with the Paris public. The &lsquo;Trois Rag-Caprices&rsquo; for piano were composed one year earlier, in the summer of 1922, and could be considered as a kind of preliminary sketch for &lsquo;La Cr&eacute;ation du monde&rsquo;. There are indeed clear similarities between both compositions as to the rhythmical and harmonic aspects. The &lsquo;Trois Rag-Caprices&rsquo; were orchestrated for symphony orchestra by Milhaud himself some time later. The same happened to &lsquo;Saudades do Brasil&rsquo; (1920), a piano composition punctuated with Latin-American influences, which was written after his stay in Rio de Janeiro (1917-18) exactly as his ballet &lsquo;Le Boeuf sur le Toit&rsquo;.<br /><br />Johan de Meij&rsquo;s orchestration of &lsquo;Trois Rag-Caprices&rsquo; for symphonic band is a most welcome addition next to the original band works of Milhaud, such as &lsquo;Suite Fran&ccedil;aise&rsquo; (1945) and &lsquo;West Point Suite&rsquo; (1951).</p>",

The Jazz Suite no. 1 in three movements, composed in 1934, had been written for a smaller ensemble. The title &lsquo;Jazz Suite&rsquo; is rather misleading, as the composer definitely uses the style of light music.<br /><br />Back in 1928, the twenty-two-year-old Shostakovich had already composed some light music. A bet among friends to make an orchestration of the popular song &lsquo;Tea for Two&rsquo; in less then one hour time, caused him to compose &lsquo;Tahiti Trot&rsquo;. Shostakovich easily won the bet as he completed the original and witty arrangement within only forty minutes!<br /><br />In the AMSTEL CLASSICS Series, all six movements are available separately.

Various instruments from different locations in the concert hall are echoing the solitary female voice. The aching, soulful melody gradually transforms to a polka-like variant that builds to the joyful, optimistic Spring main theme. Creatures venture out from a long hibernation, people emerge from their homes to celebrate, and the main theme converts again into an even more jubilant, fast dance-like scene. At this point, another well-known Swedish folksong appears as a counter melody (<em>Ack V&auml;rmeland du sk&ouml;na</em> &ndash; &lsquo;Oh V&auml;rmland Thou Art Beautiful&rsquo;) thematically supporting the giddy celebrants.

At <em>Kitty O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s, </em>new friendships are formed, old ties are strengthened, plans are created (most of which will not be carried out), the laughter is contagious and many toasts are made. During my first &lsquo;Midwest&rsquo;, in a whirl after winning the Sudler Award with my <em>Symphony no. 1, The Lord of the Rings</em>, I became friends with Max McKee. He is of Irish descent, and he asked me to write a suite based on the folk music of his ancestors. Many years later, Max and his <em>American Band College</em> created the consortium that commissioned <em>At Kitty O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s</em>. I have seldom worked on a project with this much pleasure. It was a difficult task to choose from the abundance of traditional Irish folk music. By the time I had 16 minutes of music ready, it was time to finish the work &ndash; but I have plenty of material left for a follow-up!<br />I would like to share an interesting story about the making of <em>At Kitty O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s</em>. I had just started my research on original Irish tunes, when I noticed someone in our Manhattan apartment building had posted an ad to sell their espresso machine. I went to my neighbour&rsquo;s spacious penthouse &ndash; determined not to pay the asking price. A friendly gentleman let me in, and we soon engaged in lively conversation -- talking about how great it is to live in New York, about our roots, etc. After he had told me he was of Irish descent, I asked him whether he knew of a local institute where I could find more information about Irish folk music. When I explained what I was working on, he said: &ldquo;What a coincidence, I&rsquo;m a composer too. I&rsquo;m Bill Whelan, the composer of <em>Riverdance</em>. Why don&rsquo;t you sit down, we must have a lot more to talk about.&rdquo; Of course I knew his name and his wonderful music, but I didn&rsquo;t know what he looked like. I felt as if I had just asked Roger Federer if he might know someone who has some knowledge of tennis!<br />I bought the espresso machine without haggling and by now, Bill and I have become good friends. He&rsquo;s given me some valuable advice regarding <em>At Kitty O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s</em>, and our first joint venture is a fact: His beautiful <em>Seville Suite</em> will soon be published in my arrangement for wind orchestra. Bill wrote this suite shortly before <em>Riverdance</em> for the World Expo in Sevilla. People say there&rsquo;s no such thing as coincidence -- I&rsquo;m starting to believe that more and more! Johan de Meij - New York, June 2010</p><p><strong>Background information on the songs used in <em>At Kitty O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s</em></strong></p><p><strong>The Darling Girl from Clare</strong><br />was composed by Roscommon-born Percy French (1854 - 1920),&nbsp;among the most popular and prolific of Irish comic songwriters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Deir&iacute;n De</strong><br />Irish children used to play a game in which they would light the tips of sticks in a fire, each player swinging this <em>deir&iacute;n de</em> around while singing a nonsense song set to this melody. The winner was the child whose stick was the last to burn out.</p><p><strong>The Star of the County Down</strong><br />is one of the most common in the Irish tradition, long used both as a song air and for dance tunes of various rhythms.&nbsp; It is best known today as the air of Cathal MacGarvey&rsquo;s song <em>The Star of the County Down</em>.</p><p><strong>Si&uacute;il a R&uacute;n </strong><em>(Walk my Love)</em><br />is a so-called &lsquo;macaronic&rsquo; song, which mixes the Irish and English language, and dates from the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century.<em>Si&uacute;il </em>(pronounced like <em>shool</em>) means to walk or ramble.</p><p><strong>The Kerry Dances</strong><br />is a parlor ballad published in 1879, with some of the flavor of traditional music. It is attributed to James Lynam Molloy (1837 - 1909), who borrowed the first section from <em>The Cuckoo</em>, a 1790 song published in London by a Miss Margaret Casson. It was featured in the soundtrack of<em>The Quiet Man,</em>a hugely popular American film of the 1950&rsquo;s starring John Wayne and Maureen O&rsquo;Hara.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Finale: Jigs &amp; Reels</strong><br />is a compilation of jigs and reels that includes <em>The Rocky Road to Dublin</em><em>, Rakes of Westmeath, Yellow Stockings</em><em>, The Fermoy Lasses, Gravel Walks </em>and <em>Sleepy Maggie. </em><em>The Rocky Road to Dublin</em> appears twice, first in its original form as a slip jig in 9/8 time and later as a reel.

    "synopsis": "<p>The T-Bone Concerto is my very first composition for solo instrument and symphonic band. It consists of three movements called respectively &lsquo;Rare&rsquo;, &lsquo;Medium&rsquo; and &lsquo;Well Done&rsquo;. This work was commissioned by The Kentucky Music Educators Association [KMEA] and was written between August 1995 and January 1996. The first movement was given at the annual KMEA-conference in Louisville, Kentucky (February 1996), Jeffrey Thomas being the soloist. The world premiere of the complete work was performed by Jacques Mauger and the Band of the Royal Dutch Marines, conducted by Maurice Hamers, at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam on March 1st, 1996.<br />In addition to the solo trombone, an important role has been allotted to a kind of chamber music ensemble within the band. This group introduces now and then new thematic material and accompanies the soloist, thus creating a nice transparant accompaniment. The ensemble consists of a double wind quintet (2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 french horns and 2 bassoons) plus an english horn and a double bass. Parts I and II are written in the A-B-A form and allow the soloist to display both the technical and the lyrical characteristics of the instrument. Part III at first develops into a kind of neo-baroque style using the thematic material of the first and second movement, and finally leads to a triumphant finale and a virtuoso conclusion.<br /><br />Johan de Meij - Amsterdam, February 1996</p><p><span style=\"\\\\\"><em>NB.

The symphony followed Nielsen&#39;s tenure as conductor at the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen. Nielsen himself conducted the premiere of the work, along with the premiere of his Violin Concerto, on February 28, 1912 with Copenhagen&#39;s Royal Danish Orchestra.<br /><br />The character designation of the first movement (Allegro espansivo) serves as the symphony&#39;s subtitle, but it is not clear what Nielsen meant by &#39;espansiva&#39;. Composer Robert Simpson wrote that it suggests the &quot;outward growth of the mind&#39;s scope&quot;. Within two months of its premiere the symphony was in the repertoire of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, and by 1913 it had seen performances in Germany (Stuttgart), Sweden (Stockholm) and in Finland (Helsinki).</p><p>This arrangement was written for and dedicated to J&oslash;rgen Misser Jensen, for his 45th Anniversary as conductor of the Danish Concert Band. He conducted the premiere at the Tivoli Concert Hall in Copenhagen on June 20th, 2015.</p>",

    "subTitle": "",
    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p>Johan de Meij&rsquo;s first symphony &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo; is based on the trilogy of that name by J.R.R. Tolkien. This book has fascinated many millions of readers since its publication in 1955. The symphony consists of five separate movements, each illustrating a personage or an important episode from the book.<br /><br /><strong>The movements are:</strong><br />I. GANDALF (The Wizard)<br />II. LOTHLORIEN (The Elvenwood)<br />III. GOLLUM (Sm&eacute;agol)<br />IV. JOURNEY IN THE DARK<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The Mines of Moria<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The Bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m<br />V. HOBBITS<br /><br />The symphony was written in the period between March 1984 and December 1987, and had its premi&egrave;re in Brussels on 15th March 1988, performed by the &ldquo;Groot Harmonieorkest van de Gidsen&rdquo; under the baton of Norbert Nozy. In 1989, The Symphony The Lord of the Rings was awarded a first prize in the Sudler International Wind Band Composition Competition in Chicago, and a year later, the symphony was awarded by the Dutch Composers Fund. In 2001, the orchestral version was premiered by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />Although it is not simple to summarize such an extensive and complex work, the main outline is als follows: the central theme is the Ring, made by primaeval forces that decide the safety or destruction of the World. For years it was the possesion of the creature Gollum, but when the Ring falls into the hands of the Hobbits the evil forces awake and the struggle for the Ring commences. There is but one solution to save the World from disaster: the Ring must be destroyed by the fire in which it was forged: Mount Doom in the heart of Mordor, the country of the evil Lord Sauron.</p><p>It is the Hobbit Frodo who is assigned to carry out this task, and to assist him a company, the Fellowship of the Ring, is formed under the leadership of Gandalf, the wizard, which includes the Hobbits Sam, Peregrin and Merin, the Dwarf Gimli, the Elf Legolas, Boromir and Aragorn, the later King. The Companions are secretly followed by Gollum, who does not shun any means, however perfidious, to recover his priceless Ring. However, the Companions soon fall apart, after many pernicious adventures and a surprising d&eacute;nouement Frodo and Sam can at last return to their familiar home, The Shire.<br /><br /><strong>I. GANDALF (The Wizard)</strong><br />The first movement is a musical portrait of the wizard Gandalf, one of the principal characters of the trilogy. His wise and noble personality is expressed by a stately motiff which is used in a different form in movements IV and V. The sudden opening of the Allegro vivace is indicative of the unpredictability of the grey wizard, followed by a wild ride on his beautiful horse &ldquo;Shadowfax&rdquo;.<br />&nbsp;</p>",

All three canvasses were made around 1650, during the Dutch Golden Age, when the Dutch and Flemish art of painting flourished.<br /><br />In the opening movement, the marksmen of Rembrandt&rsquo;s Night Watch show up with great aplomb. Captain Banningh Cock, reflected in the solo trombone, addresses his men. Slowly but surely the procession starts to move.<br /><br />The lyrical middle movement forms a strong contrast with the first. We hear lute music by the woman in Vermeer&rsquo;s painting Love Letter. She quietly hums the melancholy Sorrow Come by John Dowland. She is interrupted by a knock on the door and receives a letter, handed to her by her maid &hellip; at last... a message from her dearest! The contents of the letter intoxicate her. But finally she calms down and she resumes her lute playing, which ends in a peaceful major chord.<br /><br />The third movement is totally different: Prinsjesdag (Prince&rsquo;s Day): a festive day in the Netherlands! A prince has been born, Prince William III. The inns become crowded in celebration of this memorable event. In his painting of the same name, Jan Steen pictures a fine image of a messy, chaotic tavern from that time. And the music is just as festive. It starts in quite an orderly fashion, with a soft buzz, murmur and the tinkle of glasses. An ensemble plays a cheerful love song, while some inn visitors play cards or dice. But gradually, the alcohol starts working, and things get out of control. The dance music becomes more out of tune, various drinking songs echo at the same time, we hear singing, laughter and jabbering; bottles fall and break, a drunken peasant brags on his slide trumpet. This leads to an enormous climax, followed by the&nbsp; HANGOVER: a dull mess of sound with fragments of festive music. The high spirits slowly fade; everything hurts! Not exactly a dignified closing for our Old Masters, but<br />fortunately, through an epilogue with thematic material from the first movement, De Meij leads us back to civilization.<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

Magritte is, together with James Ensor, Constant Permeke and Andr&eacute; Delvaux one of the most important Belgian painters of the twentieth century. He was a very versatile and productive artist, creating more than eleven hundred paintings and seven hundred gouaches. Additionally, he designed posters and illustrated several scores.<br /><br />EMPIRE OF LIGHT was commissioned by a consortium of nine university bands, united in the Atlantic Coast College Band Directors Association [ACCBDA].<br /><br />The other movements of THE VENETIAN COLLECTION are respectively: VOICE OF SPACE [La Voix des Airs], also by Ren&eacute; Magritte, THE RED TOWER [La Torre Rossa] by Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico and MAGIC GARDEN [Zaubergarten] by Paul Klee. All four of the paintings are on display at the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice. Together with other outstanding museums in New-York, Bilbao and Berlin, this collection is part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, one of the largest private art collections in the world.<br /><br />In November 2000 THE RED TOWER was awarded the 1st Prize at the International Composition Contest of OMAN.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "Brass Band",
    "synopsis": "<p><em>Extreme Make-over </em>consists of a number of musical metamorphoses on a theme from Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s well-known <em>Andante cantabile</em> (the second movement of his String Quartet No. 1 in D, Op. 11, written in 1871). &ldquo;Never in my life have I felt so flattered, never have I been so proud of my creative powers as when Lev Tolstoy sat in the chair next to mine listening to my <em>Andante</em>, and the tears ran down his cheeks,&rdquo; wrote the composer in the winter of 1876 on the occasion of a special concert organised for Tolstoy at the Moscow Conservatory. In 1888 Tchaikovsky arranged this movement for cello and orchestra.<br /><br />The main theme of the<em> Andante cantabile</em> is based on a Russian folksong. In <em>Extreme Make-over</em> this theme is introduced in its original form by a brass quartet consisting of two cornets, alto horn and euphonium. At the theme&rsquo;s reprise, muted cornets sneak, almost inaudibly, alongside the four soloists and elongate each note of the melody, as though the sustaining pedal on a piano has been depressed. The first metamorphosis emanates from a single tone, to which the two successive tones from the theme are added in bell-like chords. The addition of the lower second results in a completely new sound world, completing the first metamorphosis. Anticipating the canonic theme from the finale, a timpani solo forms the transition to the <em>Alla marcia</em>. This movement is composed in a robust neo-classical style and is peppered with quotes, including fragments from Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s Fourth and Sixth Symphonies and the Fantasy-Overture <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>.<br /><br />The following movement features a rather unconventional instrumental group: ten tuned bottles, played by members of the cornet section. This group eventually provides the accompaniment for an extensive marimba solo, gradually producing a sort of gamelan effect. In composing for the tuned bottles I have applied the &lsquo;hoketus&rsquo; technique: each player produces a single note of the melody or the chord.<br /><br />This fragile movement is joined seamlessly to the finale, a canonic treatment of the theme. Hurtling through each instrumental group, it leads us to a festive conclusion.<br /><br />Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, September 2004</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />Full Score<br />1.

    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p>Johan de Meij&rsquo;s first symphony &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo; is based on the trilogy of that name by J.R.R. Tolkien. This book has fascinated many millions of readers since its publication in 1955. The symphony consists of five separate movements, each illustrating a personage or an important episode from the book.<br /><br /><strong>The movements are:</strong><br />I. GANDALF (The Wizard)<br />II. LOTHLORIEN (The Elvenwood)<br />III. GOLLUM (Sm&eacute;agol)<br />IV. JOURNEY IN THE DARK<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The Mines of Moria<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The Bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m<br />V. HOBBITS<br /><br />The symphony was written in the period between March 1984 and December 1987, and had its premi&egrave;re in Brussels on 15th March 1988, performed by the &ldquo;Groot Harmonieorkest van de Gidsen&rdquo; under the baton of Norbert Nozy. In 1989, The Symphony The Lord of the Rings was awarded a first prize in the Sudler International Wind Band Composition Competition in Chicago, and a year later, the symphony was awarded by the Dutch Composers Fund. In 2001, the orchestral version was premiered by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />Although it is not simple to summarize such an extensive and complex work, the main outline is als follows: the central theme is the Ring, made by primaeval forces that decide the safety or destruction of the World. For years it was the possesion of the creature Gollum, but when the Ring falls into the hands of the Hobbits the evil forces awake and the struggle for the Ring commences. There is but one solution to save the World from disaster: the Ring must be destroyed by the fire in which it was forged: Mount Doom in the heart of Mordor, the country of the evil Lord Sauron.</p><p>It is the Hobbit Frodo who is assigned to carry out this task, and to assist him a company, the Fellowship of the Ring, is formed under the leadership of Gandalf, the wizard, which includes the Hobbits Sam, Peregrin and Merin, the Dwarf Gimli, the Elf Legolas, Boromir and Aragorn, the later King. The Companions are secretly followed by Gollum, who does not shun any means, however perfidious, to recover his priceless Ring. However, the Companions soon fall apart, after many pernicious adventures and a surprising d&eacute;nouement Frodo and Sam can at last return to their familiar home, The Shire.<br /><br /><strong>III. GOLLUM (Sm&eacute;agol)</strong><br />The third movement describes the monstrous creature&nbsp; Gollum,&nbsp; a slimy,&nbsp; shy&nbsp; being&nbsp; represented&nbsp; by&nbsp; the soprano saxophone. It mumbles and talks to itself, hisses and lisps, whines and snickers, is alternately pitiful and malicious, is continually fleeing and looking for his cherished treasure, the Ring.<br />&nbsp;</p>",

    "cdName": "Gotham (part II from Symphony no. 2 The Big Apple)",
    "subTitle": "(A New York Symphony)",
    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p>My Second Symphony is an ode to New York:&nbsp; not strictly programmatic music but rather a musical interpretation of the spirit, glamour and indifference of one of the most fascinating cities in the world. The first movement, (Skyline) depicts the massive facade, the &lsquo;global&rsquo; contours of New York; in the second movement (Gotham) the brutal, chaotic aspects of the metropolis are introduced. Listening to this symphony is perhaps as enervating as an actual visit to Manhattan.&nbsp; The listener is scarcely granted a moment of calm:&nbsp; even the more subdued passages are invariably accompanied by an obstinate rumbling in the background - the music never really quietens down...<br /><br /><strong>The Big Apple</strong><br />The name The Big Apple was often used during the twenties by jazz musicians:&nbsp; if you managed to play in the New York jazz clubs you had made it, you had the &lsquo;Big Apple&rsquo; in the palm of your hand!&nbsp; Today, however, the bright red apple functions as a symbol of the city:&nbsp; a welcome object in the souvenir shops, where post cards, pencil sharpeners, T-shirts and posters depict in countless variations this trademark of New York. The subtitle of the second movement, Gotham, is another nickname for the city.<br /><br /><strong>Time Square Cadenza</strong><br />My initial plan of writing a three movement symphony with a slow middle movement&nbsp; was soon abandoned since this was not in keeping with the frenetic energy, turmoil and the accelerated pulse beat that I always feel during my visits to the Big Apple.&nbsp; To preserve the tension between the two movements the idea emerged of a non-musical intermezzo: Times Square Cadenza, a compilation of city sounds I personally recorded, which links the two movements of the symphony together into a single uninterrupted whole.<br /><br /><strong>Brief Musical Explanation</strong><br />The musical language running through the entire work is robust, angular and straightforward, unencumbered by depth or philosophical reflection.&nbsp; The symmetry of the New York street map together with the massive architecture of the skyscrapers provided the structure of the thematic material.&nbsp; For me, composing this work was both an exploration of various musical styles as well as a tribute to Aaron Copland, John Adams and Leonard Bernstein.<br />The syncopated, restless interval structure of the first theme on the horns, known as the Skyline Motif, follows the contours of the impressive silhouette of the Big Apple.&nbsp; From this motif all other themes are distilled, such as the extended melodic lines on the English horn, later joined by oboe and piano, and the massive sound blocks played by the brass.&nbsp; The whole is surrounded by repeated accompanying figures on the woodwinds, piano, harp and mallets:&nbsp; a jumble of lights and the on-and-off flicker of neon signs.</p><p>The recurrent use of these repeated sound patterns bears a certain resemblance to minimal music, and there are also rhythmic influences of such musical styles as jazz and ragtime. The addition of a harpsichord is not the most obvious alternative in this context, but it is precisely the rigid, hammering nervous system of this instrument that fits so well into the orchestration.<br /><br />The theme of the second movement is based entirely on the opening motif played by the brass; all possible manifestations of this four-tone motif are then used, in the accompanying figures as well as in the theme itself, including an extended dialogue (or duel?) between the timpani and the roto-toms.&nbsp; Apart from this, the second motif, which begins with an octave jump, provides the remaining musical building blocks.&nbsp; As the symphony concludes, a contrapuntal form of the Skyline Motif returns from the first movement.<br /><br />Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, November 1993<br /><br />Symphony No. 2, The Big Apple was commissioned by The United States Air Force Band in Washington D.C., on the initiative of its commander and conductor, Lieutenant Colonel Alan L. Bonner, and was composed between October 1991 and September 1993.&nbsp; The official premier performance was given in March 1994 during the American Bandmasters Association Convention and the Pacific Basin Music Festival in Honolulu, Hawaii.&nbsp; The Dutch premiere was played by the Amsterdam Wind Orchestra conducted by Heinz Friesen in Muziekcentrum Vredenburg, Utrecht on 20 February 1994.<br /><br />The Big Apple was a finalist at the 14th International Composition Competition in Corciano, Italy (1993) and was awarded an honourable mention.<br /><br />My Second Symphony is dedicated to my parents.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

The Companions are secretly followed by Gollum, who does not shun any means, however perfidious, to recover his priceless Ring.

JOURNEY IN THE DARK</strong><br />The fourth movement describes the laborious journey of the Fellowship of the Ring, headed by the wizard Gandalf, through the dark tunnels of the Mines of Moria. The slow walking cadenza and the fear are clearly audible in the monotonous rhythm of the low brass, piano and percussion. After a wild persuit by hostile creatures, the Orks, Gandalf is engaged in battle with a horrible monster, the Balrog, and crashes from the subterranean bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m in a fathomless abyss. To the melancholy tones of a Marcia fun&egrave;bre, the bewildered Companions trudge on, looking for the only way out of the Mines, the East Gate of Moria.<br />&nbsp;</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>La Quintessenza is a musical approach of the quintessence, the heart of the matter. By focusing a five note motif in a number of variants, De Meij tries to get through to the essence of the musical matter. The core of the composition is a lyrical middle part (Arioso), preceded by an opening fanfare for brass (Introduzione) and a burlesque variant on the same motif (Capriccio). In the fourth part (Alla Marcia) this main motif is only used as an ambient signal, and in the Finale the opening theme is repeated so the musical walk-round is complete.<br /><br />&ldquo;La Quintessenza&rdquo; was commissioned by the Carroll County Public Schools (Maryland - USA) and was premiered by the Carroll County All State Band, conducted by Harlan Parker, in Westminster on 28 February 1998. The first European performance was given by the Royal Dutch Military Band (Koninklijke Militaire Kapel), conducted by Pieter Jansen, at the annual Red Cross Concert in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw on 15 May 1998.<br /><br />&ldquo;La Quintessenza&rdquo; is a revised version of the composition &ldquo;Pentagram&rdquo; (for fanfare band) dating from 1990. This work was re-orchestrated for symphonic band at the commissioners&rsquo; request.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1. Piccolo<br />4. Flutes I<br />4. Flutes II<br />2.

    "subTitle": "",
    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra & female choir",
    "synopsis": "<p><em>Anthony Fiumara in conversation with the composer</em><br /><br />When Marcel Mandos, artistic director of the North Netherlands Orchestra (NNO) approached Johan de Meij with the request to write a symphony for his orchestra, the composer always immediately knew what this new work would be about. His first symphony, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, has the trilogy of the same name by Tolkien as a guiding principle; his second symphony, <em>The Big Apple</em>, is an homage to New York City. In fact, this latter symphony was magnificently recorded on CD by the NNO conducted by Jurjen Hempel (QDisc 97035).</p><p><br />The third symphony, like the second, has also become an ode; not to a city or a region, but to the entire earth in all its miraculous beauty and appearances: <em>Planet Earth</em>. About his inspiration by extra-musical ideas such as cities, paintings or planets, De Meij states: &ldquo;I always try to prevent my work from becoming &lsquo;story-telling music&rsquo;. I like evoking images, but I mostly try to find it in abstractions. And I keep looking for new roads to follow. In my third symphony, the musical language and method I&rsquo;ve used differ from the first two.&rdquo;</p><p><br />Still, <em>Planet Earth</em> shows clear similarities to <em>The Big Apple </em>&ndash; for example, the use of electronic sounds. &ldquo;The recorded city sounds in <em>The Big Apple</em> were a sort of heralds of the electronics that I use in the third, continuing the attainments of the second symphony rather than those of the first symphony. I use the extra-musical framework not so much programmatically but rather as a guideline, as a metaphor. When I think of motifs and fragments, I immediately know if they fit the framework or not. If they don&rsquo;t, I save them for another piece.&rdquo;</p><p><br />Interestingly enough, devising his notes with De Meij is part of abstract processes; the lush-abundant result is often based on just a few principles. For instance, in his third symphony, De Meij&nbsp; has used two triads that interlock on the piano keyboard: &ldquo;I enjoy limiting my material to a handful of tones or chords and see what I can achieve with them. I always have to seek out these motifs or cells: they arise gradually. At a certain moment I start to see structures and variants in the few notes. From my intuition I develop certain motifs. Sometimes you plant such a seed and nothing comes out of it, but another motif can suddenly turn out to be a huge source of ideas.&rdquo;<br /><br /><em>Planet Earth</em> is the first symphony that De Meij composed directly for symphony orchestra: his first two symphonies and his cello concert <em>Casanova</em> were originally written for wind band, and later orchestrated. However, De Meij has always seen himself as a symphonic composer, because while his instrumentation is for wind players, the classical symphony orchestra has always been the guideline.</p><p><br />Because of the title, De Meij&rsquo;s third may remind us of The Planets by Gustav Holst. In that work the composer &lsquo;deals with&rsquo; all planets, except the Earth. De Meij: &ldquo;In <em>Planet Earth</em> I continue where Holst stopped. Not just in a figurative sense, but also literally: where The Planets ends with a six-part female choir and a large orchestra, I open my first movement (titled Lonely Planet) with a similar instrumentation and atmosphere. After that, any comparison to Holst ends.&rdquo;</p><p><br />Now that we have mentioned the opening movement, we approach the &lsquo;lonely planet&rsquo; through a big bang that launches us into the universe. The comets and planets are all around the listeners in the opening part, through speakers that are placed around the audience. For those electronic sounds, De Meij has used the expertise of Joris de Man, who knew perfectly how to transform his wishes and fantasies in impressive extraterrestrial and eccentric sounds.</p><p><br />De Meij had further assistance when he discovered through the grapevine the ancient Greek Homeric Hymns, of which he used the ode to <em>Mother Earth</em> (Gaia in Greek) in the closing movement of the symphony, titled <em>Mother Earth</em>. &ldquo;This ancient Greek was exactly what I was looking for,&rdquo; says De Meij. &ldquo;A classical text that I could use abstractly, but that intrinsically sings the praises of the life energy of the earth. Classicist Dr. Adriaan Rademaker has helped me placing the text below the notes; he turned out to be well-versed in music as well.&rdquo;</p><p><br />The symphony ends with this cantata and a finale in which the composer pulls out all the stops. All musicians contribute to this hymn and brilliantly bring the symphony to a close; however, in the meantime a lot has happened. Out of the cosmic waste of Movement I, the second movement,<em> Planet Earth</em>, makes room for a pastoral, aerial view of the beautiful landscapes of our planet. De Meij: &ldquo;In the second movement you hear the &lsquo;big tune&rsquo; for the first time, a heroic unison melody in six horns from which much material is derived, each time in a different form and context, throughout the whole symphony; an endless hymn sung lustily, with which Homer was ahead of me thousands of years ago: &lsquo;I will sing praise of the <em>Earth</em>, mother of all!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br />Speaking of praise: with reference to the premi&egrave;re in De Doelen, Rotterdam, the Dutch press was profuse in superlatives about <em>Planet Earth</em>. De Volkskrant headline: &ldquo;Compelling symphony by Johan de Meij lifts NNO to a great height&rdquo; and reported: &ldquo;Although the three movements together cover three-quarters of an hour, and for the most part is based on a pendulum motion of two major chords, it is an intensely stirring work &ndash; owing to a fantastic sound, from the electronic primeval thundery sounds at the barren, empty beginning, up to the heroically driving final boisterous sounds. Only a film screen with credit titles is missing.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />The daily newspaper Trouw wrote: &ldquo;On Thursday evening De Meij&rsquo;s premi&egrave;re was grandly performed by the North Netherlands Orchestra (NNO) and the North Netherlands Concert Choir, conducted by Otto Tausk. The NNO has a reputation in this field.... De Meij knows how to compose, and he knows how to produce an effect. The audience in De Doelen gave him an enthusiastic applause afterward... To quote the Dutch writer Annie M.G. Schmidt: &lsquo;What a planet!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Gaia Hymn</strong><br />I will sing of well-founded Earth,<br />mother of all, eldest of all beings.<br /><br />She feeds all creatures that are in the world; all that<br />go upon the goodly land and all that are in the paths<br />of the seas and all that fly; all these are fed of her store.<br /><br />Hail mother of the gods, wife of starry Heaven<br />freely bestow upon me for this my song<br />substance that cheers the heart!<br /><br />Hail mother of the gods, o Gaia!<br /><br />Through you, O queen, men are blessed in their children and blessed<br />in their harvests, and to you it belongs to give means of life to mortal men<br />and to take it away, O Gaia!</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Painting turns space into time, music turns time into space&rdquo;</strong></em><br />[Hugo von Hofmannstal]<br /><br />MAGIC GARDEN by Johan de Meij was inspired by a painting of the same name [Zaubergarten, 1926] by German artist Paul Klee [1879 - 1940]. The work forms the third movement of THE VENETIAN COLLECTION, an orchestral suite in which De Meij gives his musical impressions of four different paintings from the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.<br /><br />Precisely as the painting, the composition is completely different from the other parts of the cycle, which are all clearly exponents of Surrealism. De Meij aimed at illustrating Klee&rsquo;s colourful, naive dream world by means of a fragile, transparent texture, bringing extensively the woodwinds into the limelight. The rather abrupt conclusion is preceded by a breathtakingly fast unison passage for the complete woodwind group.<br /><br />MAGIC GARDEN was commissioned by the Hofstra University Symphonic Band from Hempstead, New York [USA].<br /><br />The other movements of the THE VENETIAN COLLECTION are based on VOICE OF SPACE by Ren&eacute; Magritte, THE RED TOWER by Italian painter Giorgio De Chirico and EMPIRE OF LIGHT by, again, Ren&eacute; Magritte, who was a great admirer of De Chirico. All four paintings can be found in the Guggenheim Museum in Venice. Together with other outstanding museums in New-York, Bilbao and Berlin, this collection is part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, one of the largest private art collections in the world.<br /><br />In November 2000 THE RED TOWER was awarded the 1st Prize at the International Composition Contest of OMAN.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

    "synopsis": "<p><em>Anthony Fiumara in conversation with the composer</em><br /><br />When Marcel Mandos, artistic director of the North Netherlands Orchestra (NNO) approached Johan de Meij with the request to write a symphony for his orchestra, the composer always immediately knew what this new work would be about. His first symphony, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, has the trilogy of the same name by Tolkien as a guiding principle; his second symphony, <em>The Big Apple</em>, is an homage to New York City. In fact, this latter symphony was magnificently recorded on CD by the NNO conducted by Jurjen Hempel (QDisc 97035).</p><p><br />The third symphony, like the second, has also become an ode; not to a city or a region, but to the entire earth in all its miraculous beauty and appearances: <em>Planet Earth</em>. About his inspiration by extra-musical ideas such as cities, paintings or planets, De Meij states: &ldquo;I always try to prevent my work from becoming &lsquo;story-telling music&rsquo;. I like evoking images, but I mostly try to find it in abstractions. And I keep looking for new roads to follow. In my third symphony, the musical language and method I&rsquo;ve used differ from the first two.&rdquo;</p><p><br />Still, <em>Planet Earth</em> shows clear similarities to <em>The Big Apple </em>&ndash; for example, the use of electronic sounds. &ldquo;The recorded city sounds in <em>The Big Apple</em> were a sort of heralds of the electronics that I use in the third, continuing the attainments of the second symphony rather than those of the first symphony. I use the extra-musical framework not so much programmatically but rather as a guideline, as a metaphor. When I think of motifs and fragments, I immediately know if they fit the framework or not. If they don&rsquo;t, I save them for another piece.&rdquo;</p><p><br />Interestingly enough, devising his notes with De Meij is part of abstract processes; the lush-abundant result is often based on just a few principles. For instance, in his third symphony, De Meij&nbsp; has used two triads that interlock on the piano keyboard: &ldquo;I enjoy limiting my material to a handful of tones or chords and see what I can achieve with them. I always have to seek out these motifs or cells: they arise gradually. At a certain moment I start to see structures and variants in the few notes. From my intuition I develop certain motifs. Sometimes you plant such a seed and nothing comes out of it, but another motif can suddenly turn out to be a huge source of ideas.&rdquo;<br /><br /><em>Planet Earth</em> is the first symphony that De Meij composed directly for symphony orchestra: his first two symphonies and his cello concert <em>Casanova</em> were originally written for wind band, and later orchestrated. However, De Meij has always seen himself as a symphonic composer, because while his instrumentation is for wind players, the classical symphony orchestra has always been the guideline.</p><p><br />Because of the title, De Meij&rsquo;s third may remind us of The Planets by Gustav Holst. In that work the composer &lsquo;deals with&rsquo; all planets, except the Earth. De Meij: &ldquo;In <em>Planet Earth</em> I continue where Holst stopped. Not just in a figurative sense, but also literally: where The Planets ends with a six-part female choir and a large orchestra, I open my first movement (titled Lonely Planet) with a similar instrumentation and atmosphere. After that, any comparison to Holst ends.&rdquo;</p><p><br />Now that we have mentioned the opening movement, we approach the &lsquo;lonely planet&rsquo; through a big bang that launches us into the universe. The comets and planets are all around the listeners in the opening part, through speakers that are placed around the audience. For those electronic sounds, De Meij has used the expertise of Joris de Man, who knew perfectly how to transform his wishes and fantasies in impressive extraterrestrial and eccentric sounds.</p><p><br />De Meij had further assistance when he discovered through the grapevine the ancient Greek Homeric Hymns, of which he used the ode to <em>Mother Earth</em> (Gaia in Greek) in the closing movement of the symphony, titled <em>Mother Earth</em>. &ldquo;This ancient Greek was exactly what I was looking for,&rdquo; says De Meij. &ldquo;A classical text that I could use abstractly, but that intrinsically sings the praises of the life energy of the earth. Classicist Dr. Adriaan Rademaker has helped me placing the text below the notes; he turned out to be well-versed in music as well.&rdquo;</p><p><br />The symphony ends with this cantata and a finale in which the composer pulls out all the stops. All musicians contribute to this hymn and brilliantly bring the symphony to a close; however, in the meantime a lot has happened. Out of the cosmic waste of Movement I, the second movement,<em> Planet Earth</em>, makes room for a pastoral, aerial view of the beautiful landscapes of our planet. De Meij: &ldquo;In the second movement you hear the &lsquo;big tune&rsquo; for the first time, a heroic unison melody in six horns from which much material is derived, each time in a different form and context, throughout the whole symphony; an endless hymn sung lustily, with which Homer was ahead of me thousands of years ago: &lsquo;I will sing praise of the <em>Earth</em>, mother of all!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br />Speaking of praise: with reference to the premi&egrave;re in De Doelen, Rotterdam, the Dutch press was profuse in superlatives about <em>Planet Earth</em>. De Volkskrant headline: &ldquo;Compelling symphony by Johan de Meij lifts NNO to a great height&rdquo; and reported: &ldquo;Although the three movements together cover three-quarters of an hour, and for the most part is based on a pendulum motion of two major chords, it is an intensely stirring work &ndash; owing to a fantastic sound, from the electronic primeval thundery sounds at the barren, empty beginning, up to the heroically driving final boisterous sounds. Only a film screen with credit titles is missing.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />The daily newspaper Trouw wrote: &ldquo;On Thursday evening De Meij&rsquo;s premi&egrave;re was grandly performed by the North Netherlands Orchestra (NNO) and the North Netherlands Concert Choir, conducted by Otto Tausk. The NNO has a reputation in this field.... De Meij knows how to compose, and he knows how to produce an effect. The audience in De Doelen gave him an enthusiastic applause afterward... To quote the Dutch writer Annie M.G. Schmidt: &lsquo;What a planet!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Gaia Hymn</strong><br />I will sing of well-founded Earth,<br />mother of all, eldest of all beings.<br /><br />She feeds all creatures that are in the world; all that<br />go upon the goodly land and all that are in the paths<br />of the seas and all that fly; all these are fed of her store.<br /><br />Hail mother of the gods, wife of starry Heaven<br />freely bestow upon me for this my song<br />substance that cheers the heart!<br /><br />Hail mother of the gods, o Gaia!<br /><br />Through you, O queen, men are blessed in their children and blessed<br />in their harvests, and to you it belongs to give means of life to mortal men<br />and to take it away, O Gaia!</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>Unlike the compositions Johan de Meij wrote for symphonic band (Symphony nr. 1 The Lord of the Rings, Loch Ness, Aquarium etc.) his first work for fanfare band has no programmatic title. The name Pentagram (five-pointed star) only relates to the structure of the piece, on the one hand because it consists of five movements, on the other hand because the main theme is built out of five notes. (But not a pentatonic scale, as the title might lead one to suspect.)</p><p>The movements are thematically connected and merge into one another uninterruptedly, drawn in one line, like a pentagram. The five movements are:<br /><br />I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction<br />II&nbsp;&nbsp; Capriccio<br />III&nbsp; Song without words<br />IV&nbsp; Alla Marcia<br />V&nbsp;&nbsp; Finale<br /><br />Through the various ages the notion pentagram has had several meanings. The Pythagorean called it the &ldquo;Pentalpha&rdquo;, the Celtic priests &ldquo;Druids&rsquo; foot&rdquo;. Other designations are &ldquo;Seal of King Salomon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gobelin cross&rdquo; during the Middle Ages. The main symbolic value of the pentagram is that of the &lsquo;calamity averting sign&rsquo;. The devil and other evil spirits are seriously hindered in their activities by the pentagram. At least, that is what Goethe claims in his &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;, as Mephistopheles cannot cross the threshold while seeing a pentagram on a door. For the same reason gravestones are frequently provided with a pentagram.</p><p>Live recording:</p><p><span class=\"null\"><a class=\"_553k\" href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/rxv0ol7dh7stnwn/Pentagram%20-%20Wereld%20jeugdmuziekfestival%20Zurich.mp3?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/rxv0ol7dh7stnwn/Pentagram%20-%20Wereld%20jeugdmuziekfestival%20Zurich.mp3?dl=0</a></span></p>",

The first movement, (Skyline) depicts the massive facade, the &lsquo;global&rsquo; contours of New York; in the second movement (Gotham) the brutal, chaotic aspects of the metropolis are introduced. Listening to this symphony is perhaps as enervating as an actual visit to Manhattan.&nbsp; The listener is scarcely granted a moment of calm:&nbsp; even the more subdued passages are invariably accompanied by an obstinate rumbling in the background - the music never really quietens down...<br /><br /><strong>The Big Apple</strong><br />The name The Big Apple was often used during the twenties by jazz musicians:&nbsp; if you managed to play in the New York jazz clubs you had made it, you had the &lsquo;Big Apple&rsquo; in the palm of your hand!&nbsp; Today, however, the bright red apple functions as a symbol of the city:&nbsp; a welcome object in the souvenir shops, where post cards, pencil sharpeners, T-shirts and posters depict in countless variations this trademark of New York. The subtitle of the second movement, Gotham, is another nickname for the city.<br /><br /><strong>Time Square Cadenza</strong><br />My initial plan of writing a three movement symphony with a slow middle movement&nbsp; was soon abandoned since this was not in keeping with the frenetic energy, turmoil and the accelerated pulse beat that I always feel during my visits to the Big Apple.&nbsp; To preserve the tension between the two movements the idea emerged of a non-musical intermezzo: Times Square Cadenza, a compilation of city sounds I personally recorded, which links the two movements of the symphony together into a single uninterrupted whole.<br /><br /><strong>Brief Musical Explanation</strong><br />The musical language running through the entire work is robust, angular and straightforward, unencumbered by depth or philosophical reflection.&nbsp; The symmetry of the New York street map together with the massive architecture of the skyscrapers provided the structure of the thematic material.&nbsp; For me, composing this work was both an exploration of various musical styles as well as a tribute to Aaron Copland, John Adams and Leonard Bernstein.<br />The syncopated, restless interval structure of the first theme on the horns, known as the Skyline Motif, follows the contours of the impressive silhouette of the Big Apple.&nbsp; From this motif all other themes are distilled, such as the extended melodic lines on the English horn, later joined by oboe and piano, and the massive sound blocks played by the brass.&nbsp; The whole is surrounded by repeated accompanying figures on the woodwinds, piano, harp and mallets:&nbsp; a jumble of lights and the on-and-off flicker of neon signs.</p><p>The recurrent use of these repeated sound patterns bears a certain resemblance to minimal music, and there are also rhythmic influences of such musical styles as jazz and ragtime. The addition of a harpsichord is not the most obvious alternative in this context, but it is precisely the rigid, hammering nervous system of this instrument that fits so well into the orchestration.<br /><br />The theme of the second movement is based entirely on the opening motif played by the brass; all possible manifestations of this four-tone motif are then used, in the accompanying figures as well as in the theme itself, including an extended dialogue (or duel?) between the timpani and the roto-toms.&nbsp; Apart from this, the second motif, which begins with an octave jump, provides the remaining musical building blocks.&nbsp; As the symphony concludes, a contrapuntal form of the Skyline Motif returns from the first movement.<br /><br />Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, November 1993<br /><br />Symphony No. 2, The Big Apple was commissioned by The United States Air Force Band in Washington D.C., on the initiative of its commander and conductor, Lieutenant Colonel Alan L. Bonner, and was composed between October 1991 and September 1993.&nbsp; The official premier performance was given in March 1994 during the American Bandmasters Association Convention and the Pacific Basin Music Festival in Honolulu, Hawaii.&nbsp; The Dutch premiere was played by the Amsterdam Wind Orchestra conducted by Heinz Friesen in Muziekcentrum Vredenburg, Utrecht on 20 February 1994.<br /><br />The Big Apple was a finalist at the 14th International Composition Competition in Corciano, Italy (1993) and was awarded an honourable mention.<br /><br />My Second Symphony is dedicated to my parents.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

In the first place to commemorate my 35 years of friendship with bass trombone player Ben van Dijk, which coincides with my 30 year jubilee as a professional musician. (May 1, 2007) : my desire to contribute to the solo literature for bass trombone &ndash; there is a lack of lyrical compositions in which the vocal capacities of the instrument are fully utilized, and last but not least as an in memoriam for Ben&rsquo;s father Piet van Dijk (1920-2003). He was a musician in heart and soul and a wonderful person. As a trombone and euphonium teacher he played an essential role in my later career as a musician, for which I am still grateful. An ambitious inteational trombone festival became the venue for the world premiere: Slide Factory 2007, organized in Rotterdam by the New Trombone Collective, ideal ambassadors for mode trombone literature. The actual creation of Canticles was an inspiring experience, working closely as I did with Ben van Dijk. I am grateful to him for his excellent suggestions, his passion and craftsmanship and I am sure this piece will find its way to the performing arena! Canticles was commissioned by the Dutch Composers Fund &ldquo;Fonds voor de Scheppende Toonkunst&rdquo; at the request of the New Trombone Collective. The world premi&egrave;re took place on May 6th, 2007 in the Laurens Church in Rotterdam during Slide Factory 2007, performed by Ben van Dijk and the Marine Band of the Royal Netherlands Navy conducted by Ivan Meylemans.<br /><br /><strong>Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, May 2007</strong><br /><br /><a href=\"\\\\\">www.basstrombone.nl</a><br /><a href=\"\\\\\">www.newtrombonecollective.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

His last, Symphony No. 9 <i>From the New World</i>, is by far the most popular and most played; however, the first four symphonies are seldom performed.

The slow introduction of the second movement (andante sostenuto e molto cantabile) is still clearly influenced by Richard Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Tannha&uuml;ser</i>; however, the <i>alla Marcia</i> from the Scherzo is typical of DvoÅ™&aacute;k, especially owing to the strong references to Bohemian traditional music, which would play such a prominent role in his later work.</span></span></p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

The composition consists of three movements of which the second and third merge uninterruptedly into each other.</p><p>I) Allegretto grazioso (Neon Tetra, Electric Eel and Angelfish)</p><p>II) Andante / Adagio (Sea Horse and Zebrafish)</p><p>III) Finale: Allegro giocoso (Guppy &amp; Co.)</p><p>The Neon Tetra motif functions as a kind of &#39;Leitmotiv&#39; and describes the beautifully coloured, frisky fish. A number of variants have been derived from this theme and will also appear in the other movements. The Electric Eel in fact is not represented by a motif, but by a rhythm based on the restless electric pulses made audible in some aquariums. Elegant cluster chords represent the Angelfish.</p><p>In the second movement the Sea Horse emerges out of the water vegetation and starts a dialogue with the Zebrafish, which is represented by one melodic phrase in unison, getting more and more threatening by added parallel fifths and octaves. Simultaneously with the Sea Horse motif the Neon Tetra theme emerges, this time in 3/4 time and in Eb minor.</p><p>The third movement starts with only two instruments (trumpet and xylophone), but as it is often the case with Guppies their number rapidly increases. Piccolo and Alto Saxophone introduce the Guppy Theme, followed by several instrumental combinations. Every theme from the first movement &#39;swims by&#39; once more, after which the principal motif leads us to a brilliant ending.</p><p>Aquarium was commissioned by the Dutch Music Foundation &laquo; Fonds voor de Scheppende Toonkunst &raquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

From the great acclaim with which the musical was received, it became clear that the life of the Empress of Austria still appeals to the imagination. Although Elisabeth&rsquo;s life (1837-1898) as an Empress has a fairy-tale-like beginning, it takes a gloomy turn. In this production, Luigi Lucheni, the man who finally takes her life, tells her story.<br /><br />Death plays a major role throughout Elisabeth&rsquo;s life. In the musical, an equally mysterious and attractive man portrays the phenomenon of death, seducing her to the realm of death time after time.<br /><br />Elisabeth&rsquo;s life resembles a fairy tale when she marries the Emperor Franz Joseph at the age of sixteen. Her mother-in-law, Archduchess Sophie, does not make it easy on Elisabeth. But it is life itself that puts the Empress to the test. First, her youngest daughter dies. Then, not long after her son Rudolf is born, her happiness is clouded when her mother-in-law decides she must take pity on him. After her husband&rsquo;s unfaithfulness and Sophie&rsquo;s death, Elisabeth is so disillusioned that she chooses a travelling existence without realizing her husband and her son, Rudolf, miss her. Rudolf&rsquo;s loneliness is one of the reasons he commits suicide. The accumulation of disappointments in Elisabeth&rsquo;s life almost drives her into the arms of Death. In the end, however, it is Lucheni who kills her. Besides his work as a composer,<br /><br />Johan de Meij has built up his reputation as an arranger with successful arrangements of hit musicals such as The Phantom of the Opera, Cats, Annie, Chess and Miss Saigon.<br /><br />In this arrangement of Elisabeth, he makes use of the following songs:<br />- Prolog (Prologue)<br />- Boote in der Nacht (Ships in the Night)<br />- Die fr&ouml;hliche Apokalypse (The Cheerful Apocalypse)<br />- Nur kein Genieren (Don&rsquo;t Get Embarrassed)<br />- Mayerlinger Walzer (Mayerling Waltz)<br />- Finale: Ich Geh&ouml;r nur Mir (I Only Belong to Me).</p>",

The following tunes can be heard: &ldquo;Rascar Capac,&rdquo; &ldquo;When the Campfire is Burning,&rdquo; The Waltz of the Professors,&rdquo; &ldquo;Friendship Forever and Ever,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pyre,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Sun&rdquo; as a spectacular finale.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation </strong><br /><em>Symphonic Band (AM 63) &nbsp;&nbsp;</em><strong> &nbsp;</strong><br />1.

    "synopsis": "<p>With hit musicals like <em>Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Cats, Starlight Express</em> and <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>, Andrew Lloyd Webber is the most successful musical composer ever. In his most recent production <em>The Woman in White</em>,&nbsp; Lloyd Webber has employed his tried and tested formula: this one he based on the 1860 classical novel of the same name by Wilkie Collins. The story is about a man who attempts to unravel the mystery surrounding a mystifying woman dressed in white, whom he meets in the park in the evening, fleeing from her attackers. His investigation develops into an adventure within a web of love, intrigue and exposures; slowly but surely the track leads to a madhouse, where the woman from the book title is confined for peculiar reasons&hellip;<br /><br />Whether <em>The Woman in White</em> by Lloyd Webber will ever equal the success of <em>The Phantom</em> remains to be seen, but the music is definitely as exciting as Collins&rsquo; original book. Johan de Meij welded together the best songs into a striking whole, and created a worthy rendering for the concert stage.<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br /><em>For Wind Orchestra [AM 87]</em><br />1.

The locals call the compound <em>Cloud Factory</em> because of the massive amounts of steam and smoke produced day and night. The opening section recalls the North Sea shore, the backdrop to the industrial site. The factory trains are heard next: they are transporting the raw materials to the various furnaces. A lengthy working process follows: obstinate pounding rhythms suggest the 24-hour activities of the factory. Towards the end, all wind players join the percussion section in making &lsquo;metal&rsquo; sounds with empty cans and tin foil.</p><p><strong><u>Extra items needed:</u></strong><br />All winds and brass players: 2 empty cans [soda cans, beer cans etc.]<br />Piccolo: finger cymbals<br />Oboes: small and large triangle<br />Eb-clarinet: pair of bellows<br />All clarinets and saxes: a sheet of tin foil</p><p><strong><u>Instructions for the special effects:</u></strong><br />The first 50 bars are depicting the IJmuiden seashore: a combination of sounds suggests the wind and the rolling waves. Besides the effects in the percussion there are 4 different groups producing a specific sound:<br />- the brass blow air through their instrument;<br />- one group makes a hiss sound [ssssss];<br />- one group makes a wind imitation [oooh-sound];<br />- one group makes a raspy throat sound [like yawning].</p><p>* For the clarinet group [bar 91 to 150]: hold the 2 cans on the lid, so that they can bounce against each other in the indicated rhythmic patterns.</p><p>* Starting at bar 231, each player gently lays down his instrument. Clarinets and saxes start to softly rustle their tin foil sheets. As of bar 255, every player starts to crease the 2 cans with both hands at different moments, starting very slow and soft, speeding up the creasing and getting louder towards bar 276.</p><p>* Right before bar 276, everyone puts his cans down and right on the downbeat of 276, stomps the cans on the floor with both feet! At the same time, everyone starts a huge pffff sound over 4 bars, in a gradual decrescendo &lsquo;al niente&rsquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><em>Listen and watch the score with ScorePlay:</em> click<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEowYmQx1JY\"> HERE</a></p><p><em>Klezmer</em> is the traditional instrumental music for weddings and parties of the Yiddish speaking Jews of Eastern Europe. Its origin goes back to the sixteenth century. The Yiddish culture was at its peak in the countries where the Jews then lived: Poland, Ukraine, Byelorussia (White Russia), Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary.<br /><br />The Yiddish word<em> klezmer</em> (plural: <em>klezmorim</em>) stands for musician (after the Hebrew &ldquo;<em>kele zemer,</em>&rdquo; which means instrument of the song). It is connected with the professional Jewish musicians of Eastern European origin who played this music. Since the 1970s, when America started a revival of this music, the word has been used for the music style itself. Johan de Meij arranged five classics from the klezmer repertoire into a colorful selection:<br /><br /><strong>1. Mazltov</strong><br />In times past, this melody was used for the farewell as a so-called <em>dobranots </em>(&ldquo;good night song&rdquo;) to escort the guests on their leave-taking at a wedding party.<br /><br /><strong>2. Dem Trisker rebn&rsquo;s nign</strong> (The Melody of the Rabbi of Trisk)<br />This melody was first recorded in 1925 in New York by the clarinetist Dave Tarras. The title (Trisk is a town in the Ukrainian province of Volhynia) responded to the sentiments of the many Jewish immigrants who had settled in America. They formed a potential market for the upcoming record industry.<br /><br /><strong>3. Lomir zich iberbetn</strong> (Yiddish: Let Us Reconcile)<br />This is a traditional wedding dance. It is performed at the party by unmarried girls and boys who, to avoid physical contact, were only connected by a handkerchief that they held at the tips, high up in the air.<br /><br /><strong> 4. Chosidl</strong><br />This is a Chassidic dance with a solemn mood. The melody is based on a <em>nigun </em>(Chassidic melody without words). <em>Chassidism</em> is an orthodox movement within the religious Judaism, in which mysticism plays an important role.<br /><br /><strong>5. Ma yofus</strong> (Hebrew: How Beautiful&hellip;)<br />This is a melody based on an ode to the Sabbath. It is a true classic from the klezmer repertoire, and it is also known as <em>Tants, tants, Yidelech</em>. In former days in Eastern Europe, Ma yofus was just as well known as<em> Hava Nagila</em> is today.<br /><br />Marcel Salomon</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

    "subTitle": "",
    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p>Johan de Meij&rsquo;s first symphony &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo; is based on the trilogy of that name by J.R.R. Tolkien. This book has fascinated many millions of readers since its publication in 1955. The symphony consists of five separate movements, each illustrating a personage or an important episode from the book.<br /><br /><strong>The movements are:</strong><br />I. GANDALF (The Wizard)<br />II. LOTHLORIEN (The Elvenwood)<br />III. GOLLUM (Sm&eacute;agol)<br />IV. JOURNEY IN THE DARK<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The Mines of Moria<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The Bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m<br />V. HOBBITS<br /><br />The symphony was written in the period between March 1984 and December 1987, and had its premi&egrave;re in Brussels on 15th March 1988, performed by the &ldquo;Groot Harmonieorkest van de Gidsen&rdquo; under the baton of Norbert Nozy. In 1989, The Symphony The Lord of the Rings was awarded a first prize in the Sudler International Wind Band Composition Competition in Chicago, and a year later, the symphony was awarded by the Dutch Composers Fund. In 2001, the orchestral version was premiered by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />Although it is not simple to summarize such an extensive and complex work, the main outline is als follows: the central theme is the Ring, made by primaeval forces that decide the safety or destruction of the World. For years it was the possesion of the creature Gollum, but when the Ring falls into the hands of the Hobbits the evil forces awake and the struggle for the Ring commences. There is but one solution to save the World from disaster: the Ring must be destroyed by the fire in which it was forged: Mount Doom in the heart of Mordor, the country of the evil Lord Sauron.</p><p>It is the Hobbit Frodo who is assigned to carry out this task, and to assist him a company, the Fellowship of the Ring, is formed under the leadership of Gandalf, the wizard, which includes the Hobbits Sam, Peregrin and Merin, the Dwarf Gimli, the Elf Legolas, Boromir and Aragorn, the later King. The Companions are secretly followed by Gollum, who does not shun any means, however perfidious, to recover his priceless Ring. However, the Companions soon fall apart, after many pernicious adventures and a surprising d&eacute;nouement Frodo and Sam can at last return to their familiar home, The Shire.<br /><br />Explanation of the five movements:<br /><br /><strong>I. GANDALF (The Wizard)</strong><br />The first movement is a musical portrait of the wizard Gandalf, one of the principal characters of the trilogy. His wise and noble personality is expressed by a stately motiff which is used in a different form in movements IV and V. The sudden opening of the Allegro vivace is indicative of the unpredictability of the grey wizard, followed by a wild ride on his beautiful horse &ldquo;Shadowfax&rdquo;.<br /><br /><strong>II. LOTHLORIEN (The Elvenwood)</strong><br />The second movement is an impression of Lothl&oacute;rien, the elvenwood with its beautiful trees, plants, exotic birds, expressed through woodwind solo&rsquo;s. The meeting of the Hobbit Frodo with the Lady Galadriel is embodied in a charming Allegretto; in the Mirror of Galadriel, a silver basin in the wood, Frodo glimpses three visions, the last of which, a large ominous Eye, greatly upsets him.<br /><br /><strong>III. GOLLUM (Sm&eacute;agol)</strong><br />The third movement describes the monstrous creature&nbsp; Gollum,&nbsp; a slimy,&nbsp; shy&nbsp; being&nbsp; represented&nbsp; by&nbsp; the soprano saxophone. It mumbles and talks to itself, hisses and lisps, whines and snickers, is alternately pitiful and malicious, is continually fleeing and looking for his cherished treasure, the Ring.<br /><br /><strong>IV. JOURNEY IN THE DARK</strong><br />The fourth movement describes the laborious journey of the Fellowship of the Ring, headed by the wizard Gandalf, through the dark tunnels of the Mines of Moria. The slow walking cadenza and the fear are clearly audible in the monotonous rhythm of the low brass, piano and percussion. After a wild persuit by hostile creatures, the Orks, Gandalf is engaged in battle with a horrible monster, the Balrog, and crashes from the subterranean bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m in a fathomless abyss. To the melancholy tones of a Marcia fun&egrave;bre, the bewildered Companions trudge on, looking for the only way out of the Mines, the East Gate of Moria.<br /><br /><strong>V. HOBBITS</strong><br />The fifth movement expresses the carefree and optimistic character of the Hobbits in a happy folk dance; the hymn that follows emanates the determination and noblesse of the hobbit folk. The symphony does not end on an exuberant note, but is concluded peacefully and resigned, in keeping with the symbolic mood of the last chapter &ldquo;The Grey Havens&rdquo; in which Frodo and Gandalf sail away in a white ship and disappear slowly beyond the horizon.<br />&nbsp;</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>My Second Symphony is an ode to New York:&nbsp; not strictly programmatic music but rather a musical interpretation of the spirit, glamour and indifference of one of the most fascinating cities in the world. The first movement, (Skyline) depicts the massive facade, the &lsquo;global&rsquo; contours of New York; in the second movement (Gotham) the brutal, chaotic aspects of the metropolis are introduced. Listening to this symphony is perhaps as enervating as an actual visit to Manhattan.&nbsp; The listener is scarcely granted a moment of calm:&nbsp; even the more subdued passages are invariably accompanied by an obstinate rumbling in the background - the music never really quietens down...<br /><br /><strong>The Big Apple</strong><br />The name The Big Apple was often used during the twenties by jazz musicians:&nbsp; if you managed to play in the New York jazz clubs you had made it, you had the &lsquo;Big Apple&rsquo; in the palm of your hand!&nbsp; Today, however, the bright red apple functions as a symbol of the city:&nbsp; a welcome object in the souvenir shops, where post cards, pencil sharpeners, T-shirts and posters depict in countless variations this trademark of New York. The subtitle of the second movement, Gotham, is another nickname for the city.<br /><br /><strong>Time Square Cadenza</strong><br />My initial plan of writing a three movement symphony with a slow middle movement&nbsp; was soon abandoned since this was not in keeping with the frenetic energy, turmoil and the accelerated pulse beat that I always feel during my visits to the Big Apple.&nbsp; To preserve the tension between the two movements the idea emerged of a non-musical intermezzo: Times Square Cadenza, a compilation of city sounds I personally recorded, which links the two movements of the symphony together into a single uninterrupted whole.<br /><br /><strong>Brief Musical Explanation</strong><br />The musical language running through the entire work is robust, angular and straightforward, unencumbered by depth or philosophical reflection.&nbsp; The symmetry of the New York street map together with the massive architecture of the skyscrapers provided the structure of the thematic material.&nbsp; For me, composing this work was both an exploration of various musical styles as well as a tribute to Aaron Copland, John Adams and Leonard Bernstein.<br />The syncopated, restless interval structure of the first theme on the horns, known as the Skyline Motif, follows the contours of the impressive silhouette of the Big Apple.&nbsp; From this motif all other themes are distilled, such as the extended melodic lines on the English horn, later joined by oboe and piano, and the massive sound blocks played by the brass.&nbsp; The whole is surrounded by repeated accompanying figures on the woodwinds, piano, harp and mallets:&nbsp; a jumble of lights and the on-and-off flicker of neon signs.</p><p>The recurrent use of these repeated sound patterns bears a certain resemblance to minimal music, and there are also rhythmic influences of such musical styles as jazz and ragtime. The addition of a harpsichord is not the most obvious alternative in this context, but it is precisely the rigid, hammering nervous system of this instrument that fits so well into the orchestration.<br /><br />The theme of the second movement is based entirely on the opening motif played by the brass; all possible manifestations of this four-tone motif are then used, in the accompanying figures as well as in the theme itself, including an extended dialogue (or duel?) between the timpani and the roto-toms.&nbsp; Apart from this, the second motif, which begins with an octave jump, provides the remaining musical building blocks.&nbsp; As the symphony concludes, a contrapuntal form of the Skyline Motif returns from the first movement.<br /><br />Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, November 1993<br /><br />Symphony No. 2, The Big Apple was commissioned by The United States Air Force Band in Washington D.C., on the initiative of its commander and conductor, Lieutenant Colonel Alan L. Bonner, and was composed between October 1991 and September 1993.&nbsp; The official premier performance was given in March 1994 during the American Bandmasters Association Convention and the Pacific Basin Music Festival in Honolulu, Hawaii.&nbsp; The Dutch premiere was played by the Amsterdam Wind Orchestra conducted by Heinz Friesen in Muziekcentrum Vredenburg, Utrecht on 20 February 1994.<br /><br />The Big Apple was a finalist at the 14th International Composition Competition in Corciano, Italy (1993) and was awarded an honourable mention.<br /><br />My Second Symphony is dedicated to my parents.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra & female choir / symphony orchestra & female choir",
    "synopsis": "<p><em>Anthony Fiumara in conversation with the composer</em><br /><br />When Marcel Mandos, artistic director of the North Netherlands Orchestra (NNO) approached Johan de Meij with the request to write a symphony for his orchestra, the composer always immediately knew what this new work would be about. His first symphony, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, has the trilogy of the same name by Tolkien as a guiding principle; his second symphony, <em>The Big Apple</em>, is an homage to New York City. In fact, this latter symphony was magnificently recorded on CD by the NNO conducted by Jurjen Hempel (QDisc 97035).</p><p><br />The third symphony, like the second, has also become an ode; not to a city or a region, but to the entire earth in all its miraculous beauty and appearances: <em>Planet Earth</em>. About his inspiration by extra-musical ideas such as cities, paintings or planets, De Meij states: &ldquo;I always try to prevent my work from becoming &lsquo;story-telling music&rsquo;. I like evoking images, but I mostly try to find it in abstractions. And I keep looking for new roads to follow. In my third symphony, the musical language and method I&rsquo;ve used differ from the first two.&rdquo;</p><p><br />Still, <em>Planet Earth</em> shows clear similarities to <em>The Big Apple </em>&ndash; for example, the use of electronic sounds. &ldquo;The recorded city sounds in <em>The Big Apple</em> were a sort of heralds of the electronics that I use in the third, continuing the attainments of the second symphony rather than those of the first symphony. I use the extra-musical framework not so much programmatically but rather as a guideline, as a metaphor. When I think of motifs and fragments, I immediately know if they fit the framework or not. If they don&rsquo;t, I save them for another piece.&rdquo;</p><p><br />Interestingly enough, devising his notes with De Meij is part of abstract processes; the lush-abundant result is often based on just a few principles. For instance, in his third symphony, De Meij&nbsp; has used two triads that interlock on the piano keyboard: &ldquo;I enjoy limiting my material to a handful of tones or chords and see what I can achieve with them. I always have to seek out these motifs or cells: they arise gradually. At a certain moment I start to see structures and variants in the few notes. From my intuition I develop certain motifs. Sometimes you plant such a seed and nothing comes out of it, but another motif can suddenly turn out to be a huge source of ideas.&rdquo;<br /><br /><em>Planet Earth</em> is the first symphony that De Meij composed directly for symphony orchestra: his first two symphonies and his cello concert <em>Casanova</em> were originally written for wind band, and later orchestrated. However, De Meij has always seen himself as a symphonic composer, because while his instrumentation is for wind players, the classical symphony orchestra has always been the guideline.</p><p><br />Because of the title, De Meij&rsquo;s third may remind us of The Planets by Gustav Holst. In that work the composer &lsquo;deals with&rsquo; all planets, except the Earth. De Meij: &ldquo;In <em>Planet Earth</em> I continue where Holst stopped. Not just in a figurative sense, but also literally: where The Planets ends with a six-part female choir and a large orchestra, I open my first movement (titled Lonely Planet) with a similar instrumentation and atmosphere. After that, any comparison to Holst ends.&rdquo;</p><p><br />Now that we have mentioned the opening movement, we approach the &lsquo;lonely planet&rsquo; through a big bang that launches us into the universe. The comets and planets are all around the listeners in the opening part, through speakers that are placed around the audience. For those electronic sounds, De Meij has used the expertise of Joris de Man, who knew perfectly how to transform his wishes and fantasies in impressive extraterrestrial and eccentric sounds.</p><p><br />De Meij had further assistance when he discovered through the grapevine the ancient Greek Homeric Hymns, of which he used the ode to <em>Mother Earth</em> (Gaia in Greek) in the closing movement of the symphony, titled <em>Mother Earth</em>. &ldquo;This ancient Greek was exactly what I was looking for,&rdquo; says De Meij. &ldquo;A classical text that I could use abstractly, but that intrinsically sings the praises of the life energy of the earth. Classicist Dr. Adriaan Rademaker has helped me placing the text below the notes; he turned out to be well-versed in music as well.&rdquo;</p><p><br />The symphony ends with this cantata and a finale in which the composer pulls out all the stops. All musicians contribute to this hymn and brilliantly bring the symphony to a close; however, in the meantime a lot has happened. Out of the cosmic waste of Movement I, the second movement,<em> Planet Earth</em>, makes room for a pastoral, aerial view of the beautiful landscapes of our planet. De Meij: &ldquo;In the second movement you hear the &lsquo;big tune&rsquo; for the first time, a heroic unison melody in six horns from which much material is derived, each time in a different form and context, throughout the whole symphony; an endless hymn sung lustily, with which Homer was ahead of me thousands of years ago: &lsquo;I will sing praise of the <em>Earth</em>, mother of all!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br />Speaking of praise: with reference to the premi&egrave;re in De Doelen, Rotterdam, the Dutch press was profuse in superlatives about <em>Planet Earth</em>. De Volkskrant headline: &ldquo;Compelling symphony by Johan de Meij lifts NNO to a great height&rdquo; and reported: &ldquo;Although the three movements together cover three-quarters of an hour, and for the most part is based on a pendulum motion of two major chords, it is an intensely stirring work &ndash; owing to a fantastic sound, from the electronic primeval thundery sounds at the barren, empty beginning, up to the heroically driving final boisterous sounds. Only a film screen with credit titles is missing.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />The daily newspaper Trouw wrote: &ldquo;On Thursday evening De Meij&rsquo;s premi&egrave;re was grandly performed by the North Netherlands Orchestra (NNO) and the North Netherlands Concert Choir, conducted by Otto Tausk. The NNO has a reputation in this field.... De Meij knows how to compose, and he knows how to produce an effect. The audience in De Doelen gave him an enthusiastic applause afterward... To quote the Dutch writer Annie M.G. Schmidt: &lsquo;What a planet!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Gaia Hymn</strong><br />I will sing of well-founded Earth,<br />mother of all, eldest of all beings.<br /><br />She feeds all creatures that are in the world; all that<br />go upon the goodly land and all that are in the paths<br />of the seas and all that fly; all these are fed of her store.<br /><br />Hail mother of the gods, wife of starry Heaven<br />freely bestow upon me for this my song<br />substance that cheers the heart!<br /><br />Hail mother of the gods, o Gaia!<br /><br />Through you, O queen, men are blessed in their children and blessed<br />in their harvests, and to you it belongs to give means of life to mortal men<br />and to take it away, O Gaia!</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>The composition CASANOVA is a musical portrait of Giacomo Casanova who lived from 1725 to 1798. This illustrious character, represented by the violoncello, takes shape by means of eight musical scenes. The events concentrate on some of the most striking episodes from Casanova&rsquo;s adventurous life: his arrest, his captivity and his escape from the ill-famed Piombi prison in Venice. By composing this work, two of my long-lived dreams came true. First of all, I wanted to write a musical homage to one of my favourite composers, Giacomo Puccini. Secondly, for many years I have had the intention to compose a substantial work for violoncello and winds.<br /><br />CASANOVA was commissioned by the Dutch Music Foundation &laquo; Fonds voor de Scheppende Toonkunst &raquo; at the request of the symphonic band &laquo; Sint Micha&euml;l &raquo; of Thorn and it is dedicated to the band&rsquo;s conductor Heinz Friesen.<br /><br />Soloist Roeland Duijne gave the official world premiere performance on 2 April 2000 at the Vredenburg Concert Hall in Utrecht. In August 1999, CASANOVA was awarded the First Prize at the Corciano International Composition Contest in Italy. Johan de Meij Amsterdam, April 2000.</p><p><strong>Background information about CASANOVA</strong><br />CASANOVA is a musical tribute to the great Italian opera composer Giacomo Puccini. I have always wondered why Puccini never considered writing an opera based on the adventurous life of his fellow countryman. It appears that Puccini&rsquo;s favourite themes such as love, passion, intrigue and treason are to be found everywhere in Casanova&rsquo;s memoirs. Even so far as their private lives are concerned, many striking similarities are found: Puccini&rsquo;s life consisted of a succession of romances and passionate love affairs, though they do not really match the extravagant adventures of our charming Venetian hero. However, it would be totally unfair to describe Casanova as a mere incorrigible womaniser. His voluminous memoirs, entitled &laquo; History of my life &raquo; clearly demonstrate that he was a quite intelligent and versatile personality, who was a welcome guest of the Italian aristocracy as well as at several European courts. He held several career positions and had many different avocations; at one or other time he was a diplomat, a faith healer, director of the first French Lottery and even probably a spy. He spent the last years of his life writing the already mentioned memoirs and, thanks to his incredible memory, he was able to remember even the smallest details.<br /><br />In-depth study and diligent investigations in dusty archives (a/o. those of J. Rives Childs, the Casanova authority par excellence) revealed that - except for some chronological mistakes - Casanova had given a truthful and clear report of his thrilling adventures and of the tempestuous era in which he lived.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Short musical explanation of the eight scenes.</strong><br />(N.B. The numbers between brackets correspond to the measures in the score).<br /><br /><strong>I . Prologo: Il Tema di Messer Grande (Prologue - the Messer Grande theme)</strong><br />Three powerful minor chords with the brass (b flat, a flat and e minor) build the so-called &ldquo;Messer Grande theme&rdquo;. Chief of Police Messer Grande was at the service of the Venetian Inquisition and was placed in charge of Casanova&rsquo;s arrest. This arrest was due to some intrigues and vague accusations about our hero&rsquo;s so-called &laquo; wicked and libertine way of life &raquo;. There is a great similarity between Messer Grande and Scarpia, the cruel chief of police in Puccini&rsquo;s opera &laquo; Tosca &raquo;, so the musical thematical similarities are not a mere coincidence. Just like Scarpia or Javert (a character from &laquo; Les Mis&eacute;rables &raquo;), Messer Grande is the bad guy and his musical theme immediately supplies the necessary dramatic tension. The Messer Grande theme changes into the Passion theme (m. 18) with the minor ninth chords that are so typical for Puccini.<br /><br /><strong>II. Cadenza - Atto di Presentazione (Cadenza: Casanova presents himself)</strong><br />Casanova comes to the fore (m. 47) in a solo cadenza for violoncello, the latter constantly being surrounded by varying instrumental combinations. The ardent and seducing sound of his voice becomes more and more passionate...<br /><br /><strong>III . La Vita a Corte (Court life) &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The third scene (96) depicts a scene at court: the frivolous setting consists of a magnificent ballroom, complete with chandeliers, sumptuous costumes, an abundance of food and drink... and ... of course, pretty women galore. The violoncello introduces the Casanova theme (pickup into m. 100) which is soon taken over by the complete orchestra.</p><p><strong>IV. L&rsquo;Arresto di Casanova (Casanova&rsquo;s arrest)</strong><br />The music comes to an orchestral climax (173) at which the violoncello is overwhelmed by the complete orchestra: Casanova is arrested and transferred to &laquo; Il Piombi &raquo;, the infamous prison of the Doges&rsquo; Palace. Casanova&rsquo;s despair and indignation is expressed by the violoncello which descends gradually to its lowest register, while being surrounded by some dark Messer Grande chords with the trombones (pickup into 230). The heavy cell door is softly, but irrevocably, closed (237).<br /><br /><strong>V. Reminiscenze (Reveries) &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />For quite some time Casanova lies apathetically on his straw mattress in a pitifully cramped cell. During that first night of captivity he is overwhelmed by gloomy thoughts. A pale ray of daybreak light shines through the prison bars (256). Casanova reflects on his adventurous life, while we hear some street sounds in the background (masked dancers and a mandolin serenade). At the same time, he tries to find a trick that will enable him to escape from this hell as quickly as possible. The lamentations of the monk Marino Balbi, imprisoned in the adjacent cell (bassoon solo, 266) draw Casanova&rsquo;s attention. Both men furtively come into contact, and with Balbi&rsquo;s help, an ingenious escape scenario is elaborated.<br /><br /><strong>VI. L&rsquo;Evasione dai Piombi (Escape from the Piombi prison) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;<br />The roof of the prison is covered with lead plates, which explains its nickname. Several percussion effects suggest the destructive activities that will allow our friends to escape from the Piombi via the roof of the prison. The exciting escape is portrayed by nervous sixteenth note passages for the violoncello, surrounded by recurrent themes and finally giving way to the Passion theme (544).<br /><br /><strong>VII. M.M. e C.C. (M.M. and C.C.) &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />A monastery on the nearby isle of Murano is the setting of the next scene. In this convent Casanova has, for some time, a love affair with two of the nuns. Being tactful, Casanova only mentions his mistresses&rsquo; initials in his memoirs. A sugary tune accompanied by harmonium-like chords played by the clarinets, leads to a climax that turns into the Finale (607) in a very fluent way.<br /><br /><strong>VIII. Finale e Stretto: Il Trionfo dell&rsquo;Amore (Love&rsquo;s triumph) &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />We hear the Passion theme once more, but this time in a triumphant E major key (653) and after a short, melancholic reminiscence of M.M. and C.C. by the soloist (668), a presto vivace leads to the thrilling conclusion.</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>After the success of Madama Butterfly in 1904, Giacomo Puccini again selected a text by the playwright David Belasco: The Girl of the Golden West or La Fanciulla del West. Although the opera became an immediate success in America, the work never received the same recognition as other works by Puccini &ndash; except maybe in Germany. Perhaps this relative oblivion can be attributed to the subtle integration of the arias within the whole. The musical style also differs from Puccini&rsquo;s other works: in La Fanciulla he makes an excursion towards the impressionism of Claude Debussy. The lovers Minnie and Ramerrez are immersed in the authentic &lsquo;couleur locale&rsquo; of the Wild West, with its many other fortune-hunters.</p><p>Ch&rsquo;ella mi creda libero e lontano is the final tenor aria sung by Dick Johnson (a.k.a the bandit Ramerrez) before his death sentence. Already with his head in the hangman&rsquo;s noose, he sings that he was hoping for the Sheriff and the miners not to tell his beloved Minnie about his ill-fated destiny. Instead, he wishes Minnie to be told that he has gone away for good: &ldquo;Let her believe that I am far away and free [&hellip;] and that I will never return!&rdquo;<br />In this arrangement of Johan de Meij, the solo trombone takes over the role of hero Ramerrez.<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

    "subTitle": "(opus 65)",
    "composer": "Anatoli Liadov/Arr. Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p>Anatoli Liadov (1855-1914) studied piano, violin and composition at the St Petersburg Conservatory, with Rimsky-Korsakov, among others. After his graduation in 1878, he began work as a music theory teacher at this conservatory. His pupils included important composers such as Sergei Prokofiev. Liadov also carried out research on the folk music of Russia, and published a number of editions with arrangements of this music. He composed few large-scale works, writing mainly piano music; miniature compositions that later found their way into arrangements and transcriptions for symphony orchestra or concert band.<br />At a young age, Liadov was strongly influenced by the Russian national movement, in the sphere of Balakirev and company. Liadov felt connected to their ideas through his affinity with Russian melody. The oriental exoticism in his music was also notable. Through his brilliant orchestration and daring harmonies he further developed aspects previously explored by Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov.<br /><br />Although respected as a conductor and composer, Liadov was notoriously unreliable, lazy and insecure. A number of telling anecdotes are testament to this. The first is his dismissal from the conservatory due to his indolence as a student. After that, in 1910, Liadov did not finish his commission to write music for Diaghilev&rsquo;s ballet The Firebird, so Diaghilev asked Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s brilliant student Igor Stravinsky instead, who thus received his first important composition commission. The rest is history.<br />&nbsp;<br />One of the compositions he did finish, which went on to give him some fame, is Dance of the Amazon, which he wrote at the request of the dancer Ida Rubinstein. This charming work, based on two Greek folk melodies, was to be one of his last creations. Liadov died in Polinovka, near Novgorod, and was buried in the Alexander Nevsky Convent in St Petersburg.<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1. Piccolo<br />8.

    "subTitle": "(Death and the Maiden, from String Quartet no. 14)",
    "composer": "Franz Schubert / Arr. Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p>Within the art of song, the more than 600 Lieder by Franz Schubert (1797-1828) belong to the absolute best of the genre. The Viennese composer wrote his songs in a trice &ndash; often for performance in the intimate circle of his friends &ndash; and he considered them, remarkably enough, as occasional pieces which he did not wish to be judged on as a composer.</p><p>A contemporary reported of the enormous rapidity in which Schubert wrote his famous song Der Erlk&ouml;nig: &ldquo;We saw how Schubert started glowing, while he read Der Erlk&ouml;nig out loud from a book. He paced up and down with the book, suddenly sat down, and wrote within the shortest time possible, as fast as you can write, the wonderful ballad down on a paper.&rdquo; The eye-witness also reported that the work was sung that same evening, and was received well.<br /><br />Just like Der Erlk&ouml;nig, Der Tod und das M&auml;dchen from 1817 has death as its theme. And here, the poem and the music also engage in a special symbiosis. Both songs can be considered operas-in-a-nutshell. Both describe Death who holds a conversation with an innocent and fearful child.<br /><br />The prelude of&nbsp; Der Tod und das M&auml;dchen is reminiscent of an old death dance: it is the arrival of Death, who calmly and ceremonially strides into our visual field, veiled in a black G minor mantle, chords that come from a quiet darkness in which all life dissolves. The postlude is a variation of the prelude, this time in a major key. It is imaginable to see Death and the girl disappear from the visual field to the land of eternal sleep.<br /><br />That Schubert himself was contented with the song, is shown by the fact that he arranged the theme for string quartet in 1824. Like the original song, this quartet has always been greatly popular. Johan de Meij has adapted the second movement of the string quartet for concert band; in this version, the majestic Death is an even more impressive appearance in the dark glowing wind sounds.<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />8.

    "synopsis": "<p>Don Carlo was originally written (title Don Carlos) as a French five-acter for the 1867 world exhibition in Paris. Later, Verdi transformed this important grand opera into a four-acter in Italian. With its many leitmotifs, Don Carlo was &lsquo;too Wagnerian&rsquo; according to French critics &ndash; although Verdi hardly knew the music by his German colleague. For the record, the composer was not happy either with the &lsquo;lifeless and cold&rsquo; performance in Paris, and the drama &ndash; concerning Charles V, Philip II and crown prince Don Carlo &ndash; found its way to La Scala only twenty years later. This duet, arranged by Johan de Meij, originates from the second act. While monks pray for the soul of Emperor Charles V, his grandson Don Carlo takes the stage, tormented by the fact that the woman he loves is now married to his father. Carlo&rsquo;s friend Rodrigo, the Marquis of Posa, has just returned from Flanders. He asks crown prince Carlo to help him ease the oppression and suffering of the Flemish people. Carlo reveals his secret: he is in love with his stepmother. Rodrigo advises him to leave Spain and to go to Flanders. The two men vow to be friends forever in the duet Dio, che nell&rsquo; alma infondere (&lsquo;God, who wishes to instil love and hope in our souls&rsquo;).</p><p>Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />AM 105 for 2 Trombones (or 2 Euphoniums)<br />&amp; Wind Orchestra<br /><br />1.

    "synopsis": "<p>Giacomo Puccini was commissioned to write a second opera after the resounding success of his first, Le Villi. However, the original four-act, grand opera Edgar, to a libretto by Ferdinando Fontana, received a rather lukewarm reception at its premi&egrave;re in La Scala in Milan in 1889 &ndash; initially, the work was only performed three times. Of all the planned performances in the subsequent two years, only one took place, in Lucca, Puccini&rsquo;s birthplace. There, the work was well received. Nevertheless, the composer decided to make drastic changes to Edgar the most radical being the reduction of the opera to three acts, as well as altering a few arias, characters and instrumental parts. In its revised form, the work was even less popular than before. The discarded fourth act later provided material for Tosca (the duet Amoro sol&rsquo; per te), but Puccini never felt the need to defend Edgar &ndash; as he did other less fortunate operas, such as La Rondine and Suor Angelica. On a piano excerpt for his female friend Sybil Seligman he even corrupted the title to &lsquo;E Dio ti GuARda da quest&rsquo; opera&rsquo; (may God preserve you from this opera). This did not prevent Arturo Toscanini performing the Requiem from the third act at Puccini&rsquo;s funeral in Milan Cathedral on 3 December 1924. It was not until the 1970s that interest in and appreciation of Edgar steadily increased, after the work was first recorded in 1977. The Carmen-like plot (the confused young man Edgar hesitating between the love of the virtuous Fidelia and the exotic Tigrana) and the refined music make Edgar an opera that is worthy to be heard again.<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

The latter goes to King Harald&rsquo;s castle in order to request political rights for the gentlemen farmers. Yet he is trapped by the king who cowardly kills both Einar and his son. Bergliot&rsquo;s monologue, relating these tragical events, is a mixture of anger, revolt and resignation.</p><p><br />Bergliot was premiered by the Concertgebouw Orchestra, conducted by the composer, at the Amsterdam Concertgebouw in 1906.</p>",

This suite was originally scored for a complete symphony orchestra to which four saxophones, an accordion and a guitar had been added. The Jazz Suite no. 1 in three movements, composed in 1934, had been written for a smaller ensemble. The title &lsquo;Jazz Suite&rsquo; is rather misleading, as the composer definitely uses the style of light music.<br /><br />Back in 1928, the twenty-two-year-old Shostakovich had already composed some light music. A bet among friends to make an orchestration of the popular song &lsquo;Tea for Two&rsquo; in less then one hour time, caused him to compose &lsquo;Tahiti Trot&rsquo;.

This opus was completed in 1913 and was especially composed for the school orchestra of St. Paul&rsquo;s Girls&rsquo; School in the London borough of Hammersmith, where Holst was appointed Director of Music in 1905, a post he was to hold until his death in 1934. It is striking that Holst was to orchestrate the last part of this suite, &ldquo;Fantasia on the Dargason&rdquo; (in which the &lsquo;Greensleeves&rsquo; theme is ingeniously dealt with) anew as the finale for his &ldquo;Second Suite&rdquo;.</p><p>The &ldquo;St. Paul&rsquo;s Suite&rdquo; opens with an exuberant &ldquo;Jig&rdquo;, a dance originating from Scottish and Irish folk music in alternating duple and triple time (mostly 6/8 and 9/8), sometimes called &ldquo;Gigue&rdquo;.<br /><br />Also available in the &lsquo;AMSTEL CLASSICS&rsquo; series: (AM 09) Gustav Holst / Johan de Meij &ldquo;Jupiter Hymn&rdquo; from &ldquo;The Planets&rdquo; (1914-1917).

    "synopsis": "<p>After the success of Madama Butterfly in 1904, Giacomo Puccini again selected a text by the playwright David Belasco: The Girl of the Golden West or La Fanciulla del West. The western-like romantic drama was inspired by the fact that the commissioning party was none other than the Metropolitan Opera in New York, which, with La Fanciulla, staged its first world premi&egrave;re in 1910. The contract for this significant American event was signed with a golden pen; the newspapers were full of it, and Puccini sailed to the other side of the ocean in great luxury, to attend the premi&egrave;re.<br /><br />Although the opera became an immediate success in America, the work never received the same recognition as other works by Puccini &ndash; except maybe in Germany. Perhaps this relative oblivion can be attributed to the subtle integration of the arias within the whole: in La Fanciulla you do not keep stopping because the composer wishes to let you enjoy another languishing sopranistic panorama; the music rather has the steady pace of a stage-coach travelling through the land of cowboys and Indians. The musical style also differs from Puccini&rsquo;s other works: in La Fanciulla he makes an excursion towards the impressionism of Claude Debussy. The lovers Minnie and Ramerrez are immersed in the authentic &lsquo;couleur locale&rsquo; of the Wild West, with its many other fortune-hunters.<br /><br />Anthony Fiumara</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />1.

    "composer": "Erik Satie/arr. Johan de Meij ",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra / fanfare",
    "synopsis": "<p>Erik Satie, born in Honfleur in Normandy (France) in 1866 is undoubtedly one of the most striking personalities in the history of French music. He composed in various, often quite divergent, styles. Besides light-hearted, entertaining works he also wrote several serious compositions, among which the three ballets: Parade, Rel&acirc;che and Les Aventures de Mercure. However his piano pieces, such as Trois Gymnop&eacute;dies or Gnossiennes will remain his most popular compositions. Satie co-operated with almost all great artists of his time: Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Sergej Diaghilev and Georges Braque and the composers Darius Milhaud (Le Groupe des Six) and Claude Debussy.<br /><br />Johan de Meij made an orchestration of three short pieces by Erik Satie:<br /><br />I. Pr&eacute;lude (from: Jack in the Box)<br />II. R&ecirc;verie (from: Trois petites pi&egrave;ces mont&eacute;es)<br />III. Marche: Le Piccadilly (1904)<br /><br />It was only after Satie&rsquo;s death in 1925 that the manuscript of the piano piece Jack in the Box was recovered. Satie himself thought he had lost the manuscript in a bus. When his flat in Arceuil was cleaned out, a small notebook was discovered behind his piano and it contained the manuscript which was assumed to be lost forever. The R&ecirc;verie (De l&rsquo;Enfance de Pantagruel) is an extract from Trois petites pi&egrave;ces mont&eacute;es, originally composed for small symphony orchestra. In this suite it is meant as a restful intermezzo. It is clear that, as with Milhaud (La Cr&eacute;ation du Monde) and Debussy (Golliwogg&rsquo;s Cakewalk; Le Petit N&egrave;gre), it is hard to deny obvious influences of jazz music in Erik Satie&rsquo;s compositions. Le Piccadilly, dating from 1904, displays a lot of similarities with the compositions of Scott Joplin.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br /><em>Ratatouille Satirique (Symphonic Band)</em><br />1.

It consists of five movements that are thematically related to one another. The opening chord may sound familiar to some listeners: This chord and the first theme are based on the same five-note chord used in &lsquo;Extreme Makeover&rsquo; and &lsquo;Planet Earth&rsquo; in 2005: a major triad with an added 4th and a 7th.

    "synopsis": "<p>There were quite a few good reasons for me to write a solo concerto for bass trombone and wind orchestra. In the first place to commemorate my 35 years of friendship with bass trombone player Ben van Dijk, which coincides with my 30 year jubilee as a professional musician. (May 1, 2007) : my desire to contribute to the solo literature for bass trombone &ndash; there is a lack of lyrical compositions in which the vocal capacities of the instrument are fully utilized, and last but not least as an in memoriam for Ben&rsquo;s father Piet van Dijk (1920-2003). He was a musician in heart and soul and a wonderful person. As a trombone and euphonium teacher he played an essential role in my later career as a musician, for which I am still grateful. An ambitious international trombone festival became the venue for the world premiere: Slide Factory 2007, organized in Rotterdam by the New Trombone Collective, ideal ambassadors for modern trombone literature. The actual creation of Canticles was an inspiring experience, working closely as I did with Ben van Dijk. I am grateful to him for his excellent suggestions, his passion and craftsmanship and I am sure this piece will find its way to the performing arena! Canticles was commissioned by the Dutch Composers Fund &ldquo;Fonds voor de Scheppende Toonkunst&rdquo; at the request of the New Trombone Collective. The world premi&egrave;re took place on May 6th, 2007 in the Laurens Church in Rotterdam during Slide Factory 2007, performed by Ben van Dijk and the Marine Band of the Royal Netherlands Navy conducted by Ivan Meylemans.<br /><br /><strong>Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, May 2007</strong><br />&nbsp;</p>",

    "subTitle": "",
    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p>Johan de Meij&rsquo;s first symphony &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo; is based on the trilogy of that name by J.R.R. Tolkien. This book has fascinated many millions of readers since its publication in 1955. The symphony consists of five separate movements, each illustrating a personage or an important episode from the book.<br /><br /><strong>The movements are:</strong><br />I. GANDALF (The Wizard)<br />II. LOTHLORIEN (The Elvenwood)<br />III. GOLLUM (Sm&eacute;agol)<br />IV. JOURNEY IN THE DARK<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The Mines of Moria<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The Bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m<br />V. HOBBITS<br /><br />The symphony was written in the period between March 1984 and December 1987, and had its premi&egrave;re in Brussels on 15th March 1988, performed by the &ldquo;Groot Harmonieorkest van de Gidsen&rdquo; under the baton of Norbert Nozy. In 1989, The Symphony The Lord of the Rings was awarded a first prize in the Sudler International Wind Band Composition Competition in Chicago, and a year later, the symphony was awarded by the Dutch Composers Fund. In 2001, the orchestral version was premiered by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />Although it is not simple to summarize such an extensive and complex work, the main outline is als follows: the central theme is the Ring, made by primaeval forces that decide the safety or destruction of the World. For years it was the possesion of the creature Gollum, but when the Ring falls into the hands of the Hobbits the evil forces awake and the struggle for the Ring commences. There is but one solution to save the World from disaster: the Ring must be destroyed by the fire in which it was forged: Mount Doom in the heart of Mordor, the country of the evil Lord Sauron.</p><p>It is the Hobbit Frodo who is assigned to carry out this task, and to assist him a company, the Fellowship of the Ring, is formed under the leadership of Gandalf, the wizard, which includes the Hobbits Sam, Peregrin and Merin, the Dwarf Gimli, the Elf Legolas, Boromir and Aragorn, the later King. The Companions are secretly followed by Gollum, who does not shun any means, however perfidious, to recover his priceless Ring. However, the Companions soon fall apart, after many pernicious adventures and a surprising d&eacute;nouement Frodo and Sam can at last return to their familiar home, The Shire.<br /><br /><strong>V. HOBBITS</strong><br />The fifth movement expresses the carefree and optimistic character of the Hobbits in a happy folk dance; the hymn that follows emanates the determination and noblesse of the hobbit folk. The symphony does not end on an exuberant note, but is concluded peacefully and resigned, in keeping with the symbolic mood of the last chapter &ldquo;The Grey Havens&rdquo; in which Frodo and Gandalf sail away in a white ship and disappear slowly beyond the horizon.</p>",

It was a distinct honor to write a commissioned work for their 375<sup>th</sup>anniversary in 2012 &ndash; I don&rsquo;t get requests like this on a daily basis, particularly from a wind orchestra of such storied history. After taking a quick dive into the history of Landeck, a picturesque town in Tyrol, Austria, I learned how the town was a way station on the <em>Via Claudia Augusta</em>. This old Roman road was the main link between the Italian Po Valley and the German city of Augsburg.</p><p>In <em>Via Claudia,</em> the orchestra takes the listeners on a journey across the Alps, which begins on a misty morning near Venice. In a stately procession the travelers master an arduous climb and navigate bumpy trails and steep mountain passes. When the highest point is reached, the sun breaks through wispy clouds and they behold the breathtaking alpine scenery of the valley. The tour continues to a flowering alpine meadow with peacefully grazing cows. An alphorn sounds from afar - the echoes bounce between the steep mountain walls. The approach to Landeck is illustrated by brilliant brass fanfares. Finally, the end of the journey, the arrival in Augsburg, is marked by a triumphant hymn.</p><p><em>Via Claudia</em> received its world premier in 2012 during the Anniversary Concert of the Symphonic Wind Orchestra Landeck, conducted by the composer. The work is dedicated to conductor Helmut Schmid, who initiated this commissioning project.</p>",

    "composer": "Johan de Meij",
    "instrumentation": "wind orchestra",
    "synopsis": "<p><strong>Extreme Beethoven </strong>&ndash; Johan de Meij</p><p><em>Metamorphoses on themes by Ludwig van Beethoven</em></p><p><em>Extreme Beethoven</em> is based on a similar concept as its illustrious predecessor, <em>Extreme Makeover</em>. A well-known classical theme is first presented in its original form, and then subtle and surprising shifts start to creep in. Various other Beethovenian motifs also make their appearance.</p><p>Starting with the opening theme (from the second movement of his Piano Concerto No. 5, the <em>Emperor Concerto</em>), Beethoven&rsquo;s vast treasure trove of wondrous themes and motifs are put to good use. Melodies are quoted, enlarged, condensed, repeated in minimalist patterns, counterpointed, or placed in an entirely different context.</p><p>It is as if listeners can cast a glance into the genius brain of the master. Inside, a multitude of ideas and motifs tumble over each other. Some are dreamlike and exquisite, others nightmarish, frightening, and obstinately repetitive. The nine symphonies provide the majority of the material for <em>Extreme Beethoven</em>, but themes from the <em>Egmont Overture</em>, the<em>Moonlight Sonata, F&uuml;r Elise, </em>and the<em>Turkish March</em> have also been woven into the patchwork of quotations and references.</p><p>Halfway through the piece, a small ensemble creates some indispensible musical confusion, worthy of Charles Ives &ndash; two groups playing on top of each other. A quotation from the Finale of <em>Egmont</em> morphs into a jazzy ostinato bass line until the pile-up of eight notes forms a bizarre cluster. What amounts to an &lsquo;Egmont groove&rsquo; fits amazingly well underneath various other quotations. That brings us to the finale, where the <em>Emperor</em> theme resumes, played by the entire orchestra.</p><p>Undoubtedly, purists and musicologists will scratch their heads on hearing this music. Please understand that the piece springs from intense admiration and respect for one of the greatest composers of all times. Above all, <em>Extreme Beethoven</em> is an ode to the greatness of Ludwig van Beethoven.</p><p>Johan de Meij</p><p>New York, July 2012</p><p>Practical instructions</p><p>* The small ensemble (the Banda) enters halfway through the piece, either from backstage or from the back of the auditorium, depending on the available space in the venue. The Banda plays at a higher tempo and in a different key than the orchestra, led by the percussion section. The conductor stays with the orchestra and conducts the brass, contrabass, and timpani in Tempo 60. Flutes, clarinets, and piano repeat their most recent pattern as they slow down, independent of the conductor, until a few bars before 314. As it continues to play, the Banda walks to the stage, thus creating a natural crescendo before taking up position next to the orchestra. Beginning at bar 314, the conductor coordinates both ensembles. For a while, they play amicably together. From bar 353 onwards, the Banda stops playing, then turns around to march off, roughly at bar 362. This does not have to be exactly on the bar line. Once again, the percussion section takes the lead; it strikes up in a slightly higher tempo in order to play the <em>Turkish March</em>. Moving backstage, the Banda disappears from sight and out of earshot, thus creating a natural fadeout. Subsequently, the musicians take their place in the orchestra as quietly as possible.</p><p>* Additional parts are available for the Banda, which consists of 2 piccolos, 2 cornets, 2 trombones, and 3 percussionists.

He studied piano with Salvador Llamozas at the Caracas School for Music and Declamation (today the Escuela de M&uacute;sica Jos&eacute; &Aacute;ngel Lamas). From 1933 until 1947 he was Professor of Music Theory and Piano at the same school. His most popular work is Joropo, composed for piano solo. This charming work is a typical dance from Venezuela in 3/8 time.<br /><br />Johan de Meij, who was appointed regular guest conductor with the Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var Youth Wind Orchestra in 2010, orchestrated Joropo for wind orchestra. It was written as an encore piece for the SBYWO, and is dedicated to the founder of El Sistema, Maestro Jos&eacute; Antonio Abreu. It was premiered in December 2012 at the annual gala concert in the Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var Hall, Caracas &ndash; Venezuela, conducted by Johan de Meij. It has become the favorite encore for the SBYWO for their concerts around the world.</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p><strong>Evolution &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>for fanfare band<br />Johan de Meij</p><p>The commission to compose a work within the scope of the International Darwin Year immediately fired my imagination. Of course it would be most obvious to set to music Darwin&rsquo;s illustrious voyage of discovery on the &lsquo;Beagle&rsquo;, the ship that carried him to the Galapagos Islands, but I considered that to be <em>too</em> obvious.I preferred a merely musical expedition, based on the Evolution theme. Throughout the work, the note E occupies centre stage; it runs through the various parts like a centrifugal axis. As a small musical Darwin, I explore and shed light on the E from all sides, in all its tonal functions and guises, thus describing the musical evolution of a theme.</p><p>After a short, mysterious introduction in the low brass and percussion, a straightforward unison chorale melody appears in the entire band [11], a thematic subject that will only emerge fully at the end of the work [352]. The subsequent fugue on the chorale theme begins in the bass register [25], and gradually climbs up in superimposed fifths within the whole ensemble, making the tonal idiom more and more unruly. The various groups reunite in a massive rhythmic unison [107], concluding in E major. The melodic percussion extends the E in minimalistic, repeating patterns with skittish, consonant additions [116]. The chorale theme passes in four different rhythmic and melodic appearances &ndash; in, successively, the trombones, horns, flugelhorns and saxophones, whereupon the rhythmic pattern gradually comes to a halt. In a free cadenza, six solo saxophones embellish the main theme, one after another, from high to low. [205] The baritone sax lingers on its own: its cadenza forms the bridge to the capricious <em>Allegro agitato</em> [206], interspersed with staccato motions and hammering strikes. After a quasi-Beethovian sequence [306-351] leading to the main theme a minor [352], a radiant conclusion follows &ndash; inevitably &ndash; a sounding unison E over six octaves.</p><p align=\"right\">Johan de Meij<br />New York, April 15, 2009</p>",

The slow middle section features solo passages by cello, English horn and bassoon, all starting with the same fifth jump.

The fact that it would be his Opus 1 also did not inspire much confidence. After 25 years, thousands of performances and dozens of recordings, we now know that those friendly warnings were totally off the mark. In one fell swoop, his Symphony No. 1, The Lord of the Rings, made de Meij's name world renowned as a top composer for wind orchestra, a rank he retains to this day with his later symphonies and other works.</i></p><p><i>In an interview with his colleague and good friend Anthony Fiumara, the composer looks back on one of the most successful musical works ever written. What gave Johan de Meij the idea to put Tolkien's epic novel to music? How did he proceed? Did he find his voice the moment he started to compose? And finally, what are his thoughts about his ‘first-born’ with the benefit of 25 years of hindsight?</i></p>",

The world premiere will take place in&nbsp;the ancient Plechelmus Church. In this composition, I&nbsp;make&nbsp;use of the church&rsquo;s rich acoustics, and the&nbsp;massive&nbsp;bells in the bell tower.</p><p>The piece consists of&nbsp;four through-composed segments, starting with&nbsp;ringing&nbsp;church bells, imitated by tubular bells and clustering chords in the orchestra.</p><p>The second section is&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Plechelmus Song</em>, sung by a child soprano&nbsp;accompanied by an&nbsp;organ.&nbsp;It is followed&nbsp;by a children&rsquo;s choir and woodwinds for the second&nbsp;verse.</p><p>Majestic brass fanfares from two different locations in the basilica mark the third movement. We hear fragments from the&nbsp;<em>Canzon Septimi Toni a 8&nbsp;</em>from the&nbsp;<em>Sacrae Symphoniae</em>&nbsp;(1597) by Venetian composer&nbsp;<em>Giovanni Gabrieli&nbsp;</em>(1554 &ndash; 1612), written for two four-part brass choirs. A double-reed choir and&nbsp;a saxophone quartet&nbsp;mimic&nbsp;the brass choirs,&nbsp;while&nbsp;the other woodwinds prolong the echoes with mysterious cluster chords.</p><p>The work&nbsp;reaches&nbsp;a&nbsp;triumphant conclusion with the majestic Oldenzaal Hymn&nbsp;<em>Semper Crescendo</em>. The hymn uses a quote from Richard Strauss&rsquo;&nbsp;<em>Four Last Songs</em>, one of the&nbsp;favourite pieces of&nbsp;the gifted&nbsp;conductor <em>Ruud Pletting</em>, who initiated the Basilica Sacra commission. The world premiere&nbsp;takes&nbsp;place June 20, 2013,&nbsp;performed by&nbsp;<em>Semper Crescendo&nbsp;Oldenzaal&nbsp;</em>under the baton of Maestro Pletting, with&nbsp;his talented daughter&nbsp;<em>Levy </em><em>Pletting</em>as the vocal soloist.</p><p>Johan de Meij<br />Saugerties NY, February 21st, 2013.</p><p><br /><u>Toelichting Basilica Sacra</u></p><p>Basilica Sacra is speciaal geschreven voor de feestelijke heropening van het Plechelmusplein in Oldenzaal. Bij het componeren ben ik uitgegaan van de sfeer en de ruime akoestiek van de eeuwenoude Plechelmusbasiliek, waar het feestconcert zal plaatsvinden.</p><p>Het werk is opgebouwd uit vier segmenten., die naadloos in elkaar overlopen.Gedurende ongeveer &eacute;&eacute;n minuut klinken de grote klokken van de basiliek, waarna het orkest in de kerk deze klanken overneemt en imiteert. Er klinken fragmenten van het <em>Plechelmuslied</em> door het klokgebeier.</p><p>Het tweede gedeelte is het originele <em>Plechelmuslied</em>, het eerste couplet uitgevoerd door solo (kinder-)sopraan en orgel, het tweede couplet door kinderkoor en houtblazers.</p><p>Vervolgens klinken majestueuze koperfanfares vanaf twee locaties achter in de basiliek. Het zijn flarden van de <em>Canzon Septimi Toni a 8</em> uit <em>Sacrae Symphoniae</em> (1597) van de Venetiaanse componist <em>Giovanni Gabrieli</em> (1554 &ndash; 1612), geschreven voor 2 vierstemmige kopergroepen. Deze twee koren worden op hun beurt ge&iuml;miteerd door een derde en een vierde kwartet, respectievelijk hobo&rsquo;s en fagotten, en vier saxofoons. De fluiten en klarinetten in het orkest helpen de akoestiek nog een handje door alle gespeelde tonen te verlengen in mysterieuze echo&rsquo;s.</p><p>Het werk wordt besloten met de majestueuze Oldenzaal Hymne <em>Semper Crescendo</em>, waarin een citaat verwerkt is uit <em>Vier letzte Lieder</em> van <em>Richard Strauss</em>, &eacute;&eacute;n van de lievelingswerken van dirigent Ruud Pletting. De hymne bouwt op tot voor een feestelijk slotakkoord waarbij alle registers van het orkest worden aangesproken.</p><p>Johan de Meij<br />Saugerties NY, 21 februari 2013.</p>",

This first performance featured Irish Dancing Champions Jean Butler and Michael Flatley, the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra and the Celtic choral group An&uacute;na with a score written by Bill Whelan. Whelan had also composed TIMEDANCE &ndash; an early version of RIVERDANCE &ndash; for the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest, performed by Planxty. In November 1994 tickets were sold in Dublin for the first full-length performance of RIVERDANCE, which opened at the Point Theatre on 9 February 1995. The show ran for five weeks and was a sell-out with ticket sales of over 120,000. On 8 May 1995 RIVERDANCE performed at the Royal Gala 50th Anniversary of VE Day celebrations at the special invitation of Prince Charles. This attracted a television audience of 20 million. After successful runs in other cities in Europe, RIVERDANCE travelled to New York City to perform at the legendary Radio City Music Hall in March 1996. This was the first time the show had been performed in America. The show was a huge success with an eight-week sell out season at Radio City Music Hall.<br /><br />To date, RIVERDANCE has played over 10,000 performances, been seen live by more than 22 million people in over 350 venues throughout 40 countries across 4 continents, played to a worldwide television audience of over 2 billion; sold over 3 million copies of the Grammy Award-winning CD and over 10 million videos making it one of the best-selling entertainment shows in the world.<br /><br />This new arrangement for wind orchestra of RIVERDANCE is the second collaboration between Bill Whelan and Johan de Meij. In 2011, they worked closely together on the arrangement of <a href=\"http://www.johandemeij.com/cd_profile_main.php?id=96&amp;cat=9\">THE SEVILLE SUITE</a>, originally written for the 1992 World Expo in Seville, Spain.<br /><br />The first performance took place on June 25th, 2013 at the Ginger Rodgers Theatre in Medford, Oregon with the American Band College, conducted by Johan de Meij, in attendance of the composer.

The day begins with a leisurely walk to Madison Square Park with our dog Alice. We visit the dog run where she meets up with other city canines. On the way back we have a moment of reflection looking at the nearby Flatiron Building, the striking triangular city landmark. I go for a run later in the day. My jogging shoes naturally head for The Highline, an abandoned railway viaduct that was transformed into a lushly landscaped National Park. I absorb the spectacular views of the Hudson River and the majestic New York skyline as if seeing them for the first time.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>The movements are:<br />1) Dog Play (at Madison Square Park)<br />2) Flatiron Reverie<br />3) Hitting the High Line</p><p>Downtown Divertimento was commissioned by the Rocky Mountain Commissioning Project, including the following Colorado Institutions:<br />Craig Melhorn, Arvada West High School<br />Mark Dorn, Colorado Christian University<br />Calvin Hofer, Colorado Mesa University<br />Butch Eversole, Kevin Whitelaw, Mike Mozingo, Colorado School District 38<br />Alan W.

    "synopsis": "<p>The T-Bone Concerto is my very first composition for solo instrument and symphonic band. It consists of three movements called respectively &lsquo;Rare&rsquo;, &lsquo;Medium&rsquo; and &lsquo;Well Done&rsquo;. This work was commissioned by The Kentucky Music Educators Association [KMEA] and was written between August 1995 and January 1996. The first movement was given at the annual KMEA-conference in Louisville, Kentucky (February 1996), Jeffrey Thomas being the soloist. The world premiere of the complete work was performed by Jacques Mauger and the Band of the Royal Dutch Marines, conducted by Maurice Hamers, at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam on March 1st, 1996.<br />In addition to the solo trombone, an important role has been allotted to a kind of chamber music ensemble within the band. This group introduces now and then new thematic material and accompanies the soloist, thus creating a nice transparant accompaniment. The ensemble consists of a double wind quintet (2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 french horns and 2 bassoons) plus an english horn and a double bass. Parts I and II are written in the A-B-A form and allow the soloist to display both the technical and the lyrical characteristics of the instrument. Part III at first develops into a kind of neo-baroque style using the thematic material of the first and second movement, and finally leads to a triumphant finale and a virtuoso conclusion.<br /><br />Johan de Meij - Amsterdam, February 1996<br /><span style=\"\"><em>NB. T-Bone Concerto is also available in a version for Trombone &amp; Piano [AM 46]</em></span></p>",

DvoÅ™&aacute;k himself orchestrated the suite one year after the completion of the original version, and gave it the title &quot;American Suite&quot; (Op 98b). His famous Slavonic Dances and Legends were also originally piano works that he orchestrated later. Unfortunately, DvoÅ™&aacute;k never heard the orchestral version. The premiere took place six years after his death on March 1, 1910 in Prague, DvoÅ™&aacute;k&#39;s final resting place.<br /><br />DvoÅ™&aacute;k&#39;s main goal in America was his quest for authentic &quot;American music&quot; - as he used the Czech folk music earlier in his own compositions. Thanks to his student Harry Burleigh, one of the first African-American composers, DvoÅ™&aacute;k became acquainted with the traditional American spirituals. DvoÅ™&aacute;k was convinced that the Americans would find their own national style through the music of African-Americans and Native Americans. There are clear influences of this American folk music to be found in the American Suite. As in the &quot;New World&quot; symphony and string quartet, DvoÅ™&aacute;k makes extensive use of the pentatonic scale and syncopated rhythms.</p><p>This arrangement for wind orchestra of the American Suite consists of the following five movements:<br /><br /><em>1.</em><em>Andante con moto<br />2. Allegro<br />3. Moderato (alla Pollacca)<br />4. Andante<br />5. Finale - Allegro</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNyBM7EYZfY\">HERE</a> to listen &amp; watch the score with SCOREPLAY.<br />&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fellini&nbsp;</strong><em>(Omaggio a Federico Fellini)</em><br />FELLINI takes the listener into the surrealistic and dreamy world of the legendary Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini (1920-1993). His early influences were - in his own words - &quot;Cinema, Circus, Sex &amp; Spaghetti&quot;. These themes form the theatrical tetralogy in which the alto saxophone serves as the personification of a circus clown. He does not take the traditional position next to the conductor, but moves gracefully across the stage from a make-up table to a sofa bed, and makes side trips to the circus band - somewhere in the lobby of the theatre, independent from the orchestra on stage. Adding this offstage circus band &ndash; which seems to come from a parallel universe - enhances the unreal, circus-like atmosphere, like in many of Fellini&#39;s films.<br /><br />FELLINI was commissioned by Musikgesellschaft Vispe from Visp - Switzerland, and supported by the Fellini Foundation from Sion - Switzerland. The world premiere took place on November 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>, 2015 in La Poste in Visp, performed by Musikgesellschaft Vispe conducted by Johan de Meij, with Hans de Jong as the soloist on alto saxophone, for whom the piece was written. I am very grateful to Daniel Schmidt, conductor Jean-Marc Barras, all musicians of Musikgesellschaft Vispe and the Fellini Foundation for making this dream come true with their generous support.</p><p><strong>Performance Notes</strong><br /><br />* The circus band should be invisible for the audience, and should sound from far away, i.e. from the lobby of the theatre, or a room behind the stage. There are only two places in the score where the orchestra and circus band are playing together, from measure 203 and from measure 576.<br /><br />* The soloist plays the musical role of the clown. It is certainly not intended to be funny or comical, but melancholy and poignant. Clothing: No brightly colored clown costume and silly shoes. A plastic red nose alone will suffice.<br /><br />* The solo part should preferably be memorized. The passage measures 332-501 can be read from a stand next to the conductor.<br /><br />* In the opening section, our soloist sits behind the make-up table, (stage left) looking motionless in the mirror. Around m. 65, he/she takes up the instrument and starts playing (m. 67), with only the left hand. With his right hand he/she begins to apply makeup, but in an absentminded, slow motion way.<br /><br />* The cadenza at m. 103 is free; soloist plays snatches of the themes to come.<br /><br />* Around m. 123 the circus band starts to play. The soloist looks up surprised, puts on a red nose and starts walking toward them.<br /><br />* The trio of the march he plays with them (m. 44-80 in the score of the circus band), and at m. 213 he is back on stage.<br /><br />* Around m. 271 the soloist gradually starts to slow down, while the orchestra and circus band continue to play in the previous tempo. The soloist walks towards the sofa (stage right) and ends the cadenza (m. 284-292) reclining on the sofa. The sound of the circus band&rsquo;s footsteps slowly dies out.<br /><br />* From the sofa, the soloist plays the main theme (m. 294), slowly rises and walks towards the saxophones. Then he strolls toward the clarinet section, and returns to the solo position next to the conductor at around m. 330.<br /><br />* From m. 501 on, the soloist walks towards the sofa, and then collapses on it, exhausted. He looks surprised at the beginning of the Gallop (m. 520) and returns to the solo position next to the conductor.<br /><br />* In m. 560 the soloist leaves the stage again - possibly on a unicycle, a tricycle or a cargo bike with a driver - and plays the measures 592-656 with the circus band.<br /><br />* From m. 676 he&rsquo;s back on stage, and around m. 962 he walks back towards the make-up table.<br /><br />* At m. 726 he starts to remove the make-up, at m. 742 he gets up and plays with the orchestra.

    "synopsis": "<p>UFO Concerto, my first solo work for euphonium and orchestra, is not a traditional concerto in the classical sense. It consists of five movements that are thematically related to one another. The opening chord may sound familiar to some listeners: This chord and the first theme are based on the same five-note chord used in &lsquo;Extreme Makeover&rsquo; and &lsquo;Planet Earth&rsquo; in 2005: a major triad with an added 4th and a 7th. This chord has been obsessively present in my head ever since -- I could not resist using it again! Both the chord as well as the main theme make appearances in various shapes and forms throughout the entire piece.</p><p>I Andante &ndash; Con moto</p><p>II Giocoso &ndash; Vivo</p><p>III Andante cantabile</p><p>IV Vivace</p><p>V Alla Marcia &ndash; Vivace</p><p>The orchestral version was initiated by British virtuoso David Childs, to be played by him and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic at the 2015 Welsh Proms in Cardiff.<br />David was also involved in the consortium for the original concerto, written for wind orchestra or brass band. David premiered the brass band version with The Cory Band, conducted by his father Robert Childs at the 2012 RNCM Festival of Brass in Manchester, and recorded the wind version on CD [Extreme Beethoven] with the Banda de Lal&iacute;n.</p>",

Ravel also published an orchestrated version of the Pavane in 1910; it is scored for two flutes, oboe, two clarinets (in B-flat), two bassoons, two horns, harp, and strings. Ravel described the piece as &quot;an evocation of a pavane that a little princess [infanta] might, in former times, have danced at the Spanish court&quot;. The pavane was a slow processional dance that enjoyed great popularity in the courts of Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Ravel dedicated the Pavane to his patron, the Princesse de Polignac. The work soon became very popular, although Ravel came to think of it as &quot;poor in form&quot; and unduly influenced by the music of Chabrier. When asked how he arrived at the title, Ravel smiled coyly and replied, &quot;Do not be surprised, that title has nothing to do with the composition. I simply liked the sound of those words and I put them there, c`est tout&quot;. This version for solo trombone and wind orchestra was written for and dedicated to Joseph Alessi, principal trombone of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and international renowned soloist.</p>",

As a child, he encouraged me to listen to the melancholic music of his region: the full moon as the atmospheric lighting over the Gulf of Sorrento and Mount Vesuvius as a silent witness to all the heartache. Initially I learned to know the songs in the simple but striking versions of Roberto Murolo: a singer with a guitar, no more and no less. Later I also listened to the orchestral interpretations of singers like Mario Lanza, Beniamino Gigli and Luciano Pavarotti. And so the desire grew to arrange these songs myself &mdash; preferably in a scoring that would do justice to the operatic qualities of the music. From the vast collection of &lsquo;canzone napoletani&rsquo; I have chosen six songs for my Fantasia Napoletana. In Tu , ca nun chiagne a worshiper sings of the indifference of the woman he adores. She makes him cry, but in her turn remains unmoved and unreachable. In Maria, Mari, the admirer is standing under Maria&rsquo;s window night after night, hoping for a rendezvous. He sighs that he has lost much sleep because of her and he asks her to meet him in the garden, where he wants to sing her (and himself) to sleep. Torna a Surriento is a passionate appeal to the beloved to turn back to Sorrento. Marechiare is about a window in Marechiaro near Naples, where the nocturnal view allows for amorous contemplation. And in Canta pe&#39;me the lover asks her if she would sing a song for him. He wants her to stay with him tonight, so that he may die. Ultimately, La Danza is a playful Neapolitan tarantella, composed by Gioacchino Rossini that became world famous in the orchestration of Ottorino Respighi. The latter arranged the music for a ballet, and you can certainly hear that inspiration: it&rsquo;s hard to sit still during this fresh whirlwind. I found it fantastic that my good friend the composer Johan de Meij enthusiastically supported my writing of Fantasia Napoletana for wind band. He assisted me with great advice and awarded me a generous glimpse into his musical kitchen. Working together on the fantasy was great fun and I am honoured that De Meij&rsquo;s company Amstel Music publishes this work. I dedicate Fantasia Napoletana to my father, Antonio Fiumara. This is, after all, all his fault &mdash; and I am grateful for that.</p><p>Anthony Fiumara Amsterdam, May 2014</p>",

It highlights the following songs:<br /><br /><strong>Sansa Kroma</strong> (Little Hawk) is a happy, buoyant melody familiar to the playgrounds of Ghana. While the children sing, a rock is passed around the circle to add to the kids&rsquo; fun.</p><p><strong>Thula Thu Baba</strong> (Keep Quiet My Child) This well-loved lullaby is deeply ingrained into the Pan-African culture. The sounds of the words &ldquo;to be silent&rdquo; in the Xhosa language are themselves gorgeous and soothing. The lyrics roughly translate as: &ldquo;God bless this land called Africa, may your spirits come and keep our conflicts far away.&rdquo;</p><p>The song <strong>Khuluma</strong> (Speak) was made famous by South-African singer Miriam Makeba. It is a story from the Townships of an unwanted suitor who is rebuffed by a woman whose husband has not yet returned from his job in the city. When the husband returns, he tells the visitor to stay away from his beloved.</p><p><strong>Ilanga libuya, ilanga liyaphuma</strong> (The Sun Comes, The Sun Rises) This is a paean, a song of joy in the Zulu language to the promise of a new day.<br /><br /><strong>Tshotsholoza </strong>(Go Forward)â€¨ is a traditional Zimbabwean Ndebele tribal song, delivered in call-and-response style. Male migrant miners used to sing this song. It became so popular in South-African culture that the song is often referred to as South-Africa&rsquo;s second national anthem. The South-African soccer team sang Tshotsholoza as they charged onto the field of play for the opening of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in Johannesburg.</p><p><strong>African Harmony</strong> was commissioned by Richard R. Fischer, Professor of Music at Concordia University, Chicago.</p>",

It is written for two tenor trombones and follows the notable offspring, my 1995 T-Bone Concerto. This new work is written for and dedicated to trombone legends Joseph Alessi and J&ouml;rgen van Rijen. who, in my mind, are among the world&rsquo;s finest trombone players. Besides Alessi&#39;s and Van Rijen&rsquo;s orchestral positions as principal trombone with the New York Philharmonic and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam respectively, they both have built outstanding careers as soloists, and they also frequently perform together with the World Trombone Quartet, along with Michel Becquet and Stefan Schulz.</p><p>The trombone was my primary instrument during earlier years when I was performing more than composing or conducting, and it will always remain close to my musical heart.&nbsp;I had the honor to conduct both Joe and J&ouml;rgen separately many times in performances of T-Bone Concerto all over the globe, and we all have become close friends. So it was about time I wrote a piece to&nbsp;showcase both their highly individual, yet equally stellar virtuosity and witness their chemistry on stage.&nbsp;No commission involved, I wrote Two-Bone Concerto purely out of friendship and admiration for their fabulous musicianship.</p><p>The world premi&egrave;re of Two-Bone Concerto took place during the International Trombone Festival at the Juilliard School of Music in New York.

Ravel also published an orchestrated version of the Pavane in 1910; it is scored for two flutes, oboe, two clarinets (in B-flat), two bassoons, two horns, harp, and strings. Ravel described the piece as &quot;an evocation of a pavane that a little princess [infanta] might, in former times, have danced at the Spanish court&quot;. The pavane was a slow processional dance that enjoyed great popularity in the courts of Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Ravel dedicated the Pavane to his patron, the Princesse de Polignac. The work soon became very popular, although Ravel came to think of it as &quot;poor in form&quot; and unduly influenced by the music of Chabrier. When asked how he arrived at the title, Ravel smiled coyly and replied, &quot;Do not be surprised, that title has nothing to do with the composition. I simply liked the sound of those words and I put them there, c`est tout&quot;. This version for solo trombone and symphonic brass was written for and dedicated to Joseph Alessi, principal trombone of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and international renowned soloist.</span></span></p><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Palatino; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">INSTRUMENTATION:</span></span><br />&nbsp;</div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Palatino; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Trombone <span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">(solo)</span></span> (C) </span></span></div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Palatino; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\"><br /><div><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Trumpet 1 in Bb (doubling piccolo trumpet)<br />Trumpet 2 in Bb<br />Trumpet 3 in Bb<br /><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Flugelhorn</span></span> in Bb </span></span></div><div><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Horns 1, 3 (in F)<br />Horns 2, 4 (in F)<br /><br />Trombone 1 (C)<br />Trombone 2 (C)<br />Bass Trombone &nbsp;(C)<br /><br />Euphonium (Bb)<br />Tuba (C)<br /><br />Harp<br />Timpani</span></span></div></div>",

JOURNEY IN THE DARK</strong><br />The fourth movement describes the laborious journey of the Fellowship of the Ring, headed by the wizard Gandalf, through the dark tunnels of the Mines of Moria. The slow walking cadenza and the fear are clearly audible in the monotonous rhythm of the low brass, piano and percussion. After a wild persuit by hostile creatures, the Orks, Gandalf is engaged in battle with a horrible monster, the Balrog, and crashes from the subterranean bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m in a fathomless abyss. To the melancholy tones of a Marcia fun&egrave;bre, the bewildered Companions trudge on, looking for the only way out of the Mines, the East Gate of Moria.</p><p>INSTRUMENTATION:</p><p>1.

Tolkien, with his&nbsp;<strong>Symphony No. 5 Return to Middle Earth</strong>. Although there are some thematic reminiscences of his monumental first symphony The Lord of the Rings from 1988, De Meij is putting a completely different musical vibe into this new symphony. There is an important role for a solo soprano and a mixed choir: they sing in Ilkorin, one of the Elvish languages â€‹â€‹of Middle-Earth. The Orcs and other thugs also take the stage, but they only use raw screams in their own language, also known as &#39;black speech&#39;.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif;\">The 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;symphony consists of six movements:</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif;\">I) M&icirc;ri na F&euml;anor (F&euml;anor&rsquo;s Jewels)<br />II) Tin&uacute;viel (Nightingale)<br />III) Ancalagon i-m&ocirc;r (Ancalagon, The Black)<br />IV) Arwen Und&oacute;miel (Evenstar)<br />V) Dagor Delothrin (The War of Wrath)<br />VI) Thuringwethil (Woman of Secret Shadow)</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">The symphony was commissioned by The Middle Earth Consortium Project, organized by the Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Indiana (USA).

They glowed alternately, so there was never darkness in the Undying Lands. FeÌˆanor, the great Noldorin artisan, captured the light of the Trees in crystal <em>silima</em> and crafted three fabulous jewels. The theft of these jewels by the renegade god Morgoth, precipitated all of the disastrous events of the First Age of Beleriand and, indeed, of all Middle-earth in the ages to follow.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">II) TinuÌviel (Nightingale)</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">TinuÌviel, daughter of Melian the Maia and Thingol of Doriath, and her mortal lover, Beren, succeeded in wresting one of the Jewels of FeÌˆanor from Morgoth&rsquo;s crown. Thingol had set that feat of daring as the bride price for his daughter&rsquo;s hand, not expecting Beren to succeed. He did succeed, however, with TinuÌviel&rsquo;s help&mdash;but Carcharoth, the great wolf of Angband, swallowed the jewel and Beren&rsquo;s hand as the couple escaped. Later on, Carcharoth killed Beren and was in turn slain - the jewel was retrieved intact from his carcass. TinuÌviel died of grief, following her lover to the Halls of Mandos. There she sang of her grief to the God of the Dead, who granted her choice of returning from the dead with Beren, in exchange for her own immortality.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">III) Ancalagon i-moÌ‚r (Ancalagon the Black)</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">The greatest of Morgoth&rsquo;s winged dragons, Ancalagon the Black was defeated in the War of Wrath by EaÌˆrendil the Mariner (husband of Elwing, TinuÌviel&rsquo;s granddaughter). EaÌˆrendil succeeded in sailing to the Undying Lands using the light of the Jewel of FeÌˆanor, which his wife had inherited. He battled Ancalagon in the sky above Morgoth&rsquo;s stronghold, and the fall of the dragon crushed the towers of Thangorodrim, punctuating Morgoth&rsquo;s ultimate defeat.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">IV) Arwen UndoÌmiel (Evenstar)</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">Arwen UndoÌmiel was a direct descendant of TinuÌviel of Doriath. It was said that Arwen looked just like her great-great-grandmother. As Queen of Gondor, Arwen considered her mortality, chosen for love of the mortal Aragorn, as did her ancestress, TinuÌviel&mdash;a lifetime of love versus an eternity bereft of love.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">V) Dagor Delothrin (The War of Wrath)</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">The host of the Valar marched from the Undying Lands in the uttermost West and summoned all Elves and Men to join in confronting the forces of Morgoth. The battle lasted fifty years, but in the end, Morgoth&rsquo;s fire demons and legions of Orcs were destroyed. EaÌˆrendil appeared in the sky in his vessel Gwingeloth, along with Thorondor, King of the Eagles, and battle ensued between all the flying creatures. Morgoth was pursued into his mines and finally captured, bound with an unbreakable chain made of <em>tilkal</em>, and cast into the Timeless Void beyond the Walls of the World, to remain there until the breaking of the world.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">VI) Thuringwethil (Woman of Secret Shadow)</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\">No one knows how Thuringwethil, the vampire servant of Morgoth, died&mdash;but TinuÌviel wore her fell on her quest with Beren to steal the Jewels of FeÌˆanor from Morgoth&rsquo;s crown.

What an honor to write for a musical group founded in 1828. I gave conductor Ronald Demkee an enthusiastic: Yes! My first idea was composing an instrumental suite based on Pennsylvania folk songs. Demkee agreed, and I began researching the musical heritage of The Keystone State. But after three weeks of looking under every musical rock, I was coming up with nothing: I came to the disappointing conclusion that there were no adequately inspiring melodies to attribute solely to the state. After wringing my hands for quite a bit, I phoned Demkee with a preposterous proposal: &ldquo;Pennsylvania <strong>should</strong> have its own folk songs. What if I made them up myself?&rdquo; Spontaneous laughter erupted on the other side of the line. Yet Demkee gave me the green light. It resulted in a suite of five songs&mdash;all of which <strong>could</strong> have come from Pennsylvanian denizens long time ago:<br /><br />On the Banks of the Susquehanna River<br />The Gettysburg March<br />The Girl from Allegheny<br />The Punxsutawney Groundhog Waltz<br />The Allentown Jig<br /><br />The world premiere was enthusiastically received on the Fourth of July, 2018, performed by The Allentown Band under the composer&rsquo;s baton, exactly 190 years after their very first concert in 1928.</p>",

In the first place to commemorate my 35 years of friendship with bass trombone player Ben van Dijk, which coincides with my 30 year jubilee as a professional musician. (May 1, 2007) : my desire to contribute to the solo literature for bass trombone &ndash; there is a lack of lyrical compositions in which the vocal capacities of the instrument are fully utilized, and last but not least as an in memoriam for Ben&rsquo;s father Piet van Dijk (1920-2003). He was a musician in heart and soul and a wonderful person. As a trombone and euphonium teacher he played an essential role in my later career as a musician, for which I am still grateful. An ambitious inteational trombone festival became the venue for the world premiere: Slide Factory 2007, organized in Rotterdam by the New Trombone Collective, ideal ambassadors for mode trombone literature. The actual creation of Canticles was an inspiring experience, working closely as I did with Ben van Dijk. I am grateful to him for his excellent suggestions, his passion and craftsmanship and I am sure this piece will find its way to the performing arena! Canticles was commissioned by the Dutch Composers Fund &ldquo;Fonds voor de Scheppende Toonkunst&rdquo; at the request of the New Trombone Collective. The world premi&egrave;re took place on May 6th, 2007 in the Laurens Church in Rotterdam during Slide Factory 2007, performed by Ben van Dijk and the Marine Band of the Royal Netherlands Navy conducted by Ivan Meylemans.<br /><br /><strong>Johan de Meij<br />Amsterdam, May 2007</strong><br /><br /><a href=\"\">www.basstrombone.nl</a><br /><a href=\"\">www.newtrombonecollective.com</a></p>",

In addition to being a gifted painter and visual artist, he was also an astrologer, urban planner, architect, inventor, engineer, philosopher, physicist, chemist, anatomist, sculptor, writer and composer. Da Vinci&rsquo;s story stirred my own curiosity and creativity. It spurred me to experiment with my musical material. I wondered what music I could invent with, for instance, using only the ivory keys of the piano.<br /><br />DA VINCI opens with a grand, massive chord over five octaves throughout the orchestra. This chord, the Da Vinci Chord, is the connective tissue between the various sections. In the opening sequence, <em>The Vitruvian Man</em>, I experimented with the symmetry of the Da Vinci Chord with ascending and descending cluster chords. In <em>Mona Lisa,</em> a recorder quartet suddenly emerges from the ensemble, to play a motet by Da Vinci&rsquo;s contemporary Josquin Des Prez: &quot;In te Domine speravi&quot; (In You We Trust My Lord). Rapid ascending phrases in <em>Vola, Vola!</em> illustrate Da Vinci&#39;s passionate desire to fly. The Florentine designed various aircrafts, some of which could actually get off the ground, as later studies have shown. In <em>Macchinario</em> (machineries) I played around with the interval D-A, the first two letters of his last name, until the Da Vinci Chord abruptly bridges into a repeat of <em>Vola, Vola!</em> Virtuoso passages swirl through the entire ensemble and suggest a daring trip through the skies. With the Da Vinci Chord we finally end on a radiant C major chord, as an ode to one of the greatest geniuses of all time.</p><p>Johan de Meij<br />New York, February 2019</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Together with the Marine Band of the Royal Netherlands Navy, Calefax premi&egrave;red a new work by De Meij: Un Momento Dado, an ode to another Dutch phenomenon, the legendary soccer player Johan Cruyff. </span></b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:23.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">Dutch composer Johan de Meij (1953) and the Calefax reed quintet have common roots in the Dutch music scene of the 1980s and 90s. In view of this, one wonders why it took so long for them to team up. Could it be because chamber music and wind orchestras<span style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"> </span>are still worlds apart? Or did the geographical distance play a role, since De Meij moved to New York in 2008? Whatever the case may be, the time is ripe to forge a connection between these two success stories. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:21.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">When Calefax first emerged on the Dutch music scene, De Meij was still a trombonist, active in ensembles such as Orkest de Volharding, whose founders in 1972 included Louis Andriessen, Willem Breuker and Jan Wolff (the latter was to play a significant role in Calefax&rsquo;s early career, in his capacity as director of the Dutch contemporary music centre De IJsbreker). De Meij played in this celebrated ensemble for two decades, experiencing major changes at close hand &ndash; as the ensemble transformed from a politically engaged band into a contemporary music ensemble with conductor. When he first joined De Volharding in 1988, De Meij was putting the finishing touches to the work that would signify his breakthrough as a composer; his first symphony &lsquo;The Lord of the Rings&rsquo; for large-scale</span><span mso-bidi-font-family:=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\"> </span><span mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">wind orchestra. In the years he spent with De Volharding, De Meij premi&egrave;red over 300 works: these have been influential in shaping his compositional thinking and approach. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:21.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">Now De Meij and Calefax join forces at last, after many years of ripening, each in their own musical universe. Calefax approached De Meij in 2017; it was a difficult time for him, as he had recently broken his ankle in a skiing accident. Usually, De Meij would be constantly travelling as a conductor, mostly of his own works; however, suddenly he found himself confined to his bed for at least six weeks. There was at least one positive side to this; he had more time for composing, and his first meetings with Calefax&rsquo;s bassoonist Alban Wesly were coloured by typical Cruyffian catchphrases, such as &lsquo;<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif;\"><span style=\"caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; -moz-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><em>Every downside has its upside</em></span></span></span></span>&rsquo;. De Meij: &ldquo;the association with Johan Cruyff has proved to be fruitful. When we talk about Cruyff, it is in terms of virtuosity, creativity, capriciousness and radical innovation. I also observe these qualities in Calefax, a group that has created an entirely new chamber music genre with its unique instrumental line-up. So I was inspired to name the piece &lsquo;Un Momento Dado&rsquo;, a reference to Johan Cruyff&rsquo;s idiosyncrasy and passion. Cruyff once spoke these words &lsquo;en un momento dado&rsquo; at a press conference in his Catalan years. Those present were left guessing at the meaning of the extremely literally translated phrase &lsquo;at a given moment&rsquo;, above all, pronounced with an Amsterdam accent. But the funny thing is that the Spanish were so delighted by this phrase that it was instantly<i> </i>adopted into everyday Spanish<span style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:italic\">. So this brings to mind Calefax</span>, a truly inspired group that has displayed a single-minded, creative drive for the past 34 years, conquering a place in the chamber music world for its idiosyncratic instrumental combination.&rdquo; </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:21.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">With strong encouragement from the Calefax musicians, De Meij opted for a <i>Concerto Gross</i>o-like form for his new work, in which the reed quintet and the wind orchestra seamlessly alternate with each other, as well as occasionally combining forces. During the majestic orchestral opening of two minutes duration, with its expectant trumpet flourishes and a notable role for the harp, one can instantly hear the musical point of departure that De Meij chose for Un Momento Dado. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:21.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">This <i>Leitmotiv</i> comprises the notes C-A-E-F-A: the note names that appear as letters in the name CALEFAX. In its pure form this motif is first heard when the reed quintet makes its first appearance, introduced by the oboe. What follows is a succession of inspiring musical ideas with richly expressive colour combinations. In this context, De Meij creates striking moments when he connects one of Calefax&rsquo;s instruments to a group from the wind orchestra; a dreamy passage for the saxophonist Raaf Hekkema together with the saxophone section, and the oboist Oliver Boekhoorn combined with the band&rsquo;s double reed instruments. There is also a moment in which Calefax is responded <s>to</s> by the same five wind players in the orchestra, who De Meij jokingly refers to as &ldquo;Shadowfax&rdquo;. The C-A-E-F-A motif returns in various forms, ultimately even as a quote from Richard Strauss&rsquo;s celebrated Tijl Uilenspiegel tune, which it recalls, before sprinting to a triumphant conclusion in a virtuosic cascade of sounds. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:21.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">For years, Calefax had set itself the goal of making its repertoire available to other reed quintets. Early this century, the group began publishing sheet music of its arrangements in the CALEFAX EDITION. Scores and parts are available in the calefax.nl web shop and orders come in from all over the world. In addition, Calefax is extending the repertoire of original works for reed quintet by commissioning works and by organising an annual composers&rsquo; competition. At present there are no less than 40 reed quintets throughout the world; a number that is steadily increasing. Calefax hopes to boost this growth by entering the world of the wind orchestras. After all, every wind orchestra includes the instrumental line-up for a reed quintet! </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:21.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none\"><span mso-hansi-theme-font:=\"\" style=\"font-family:\">The premi&egrave;re of Un Momento Dado took place on 10 January, 2020 in Tilburg, under the direction of the Marine Band&rsquo;s chief conductor, Arjan Tien. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span mso-ascii-theme-font:=\"\" new=\"\" style=\"font-family:\" times=\"\">&copy;AW 2019<br />&nbsp;</span></p><p><style type=\"text/css\"></style><style type=\"text/css\"></style><strong>Un Momento Dado</strong></p><p><strong><em>Homenaje en memoria de Johan Cruijff (1947-2016)&nbsp;<br />Concerto Grosso voor rietkwintet en harmonieorkest</em></strong></p><p>Rietkwintet Calefax betreedt de wereld van de harmonieorkesten</p><p>-door Alban Wesly-</p><p><strong>In januari 2020 komt de langverwachte samenwerking van de grond tussen Nederlands meest gespeelde componist, Johan de Meij, en &eacute;&eacute;n van Europa&rsquo;s meest succesvolle kamermuziekgroepen, rietkwintet Calefax. Samen met de Marinierskapel der Koninklijke Marine brengt Calefax een nieuw werk van De Meij in premi&egrave;re: Un Momento Dado, een ode aan een ander Nederlands fenomeen, Johan Cruijff.</strong></p><p>Componist Johan de Meij (1953) en rietkwintet Calefax hebben gemeenschappelijke wortels in het Nederlandse muziekleven van de jaren 1980 en &lsquo;90. In dat licht is het verrassend dat het zo lang heeft geduurd voordat een samenwerking van de grond kwam. Komt het doordat de kamermuziek en de HaFaBra nog steeds behoorlijk gescheiden werelden zijn? Of door de geografische afstand, sinds De Meij in 2008 naar New York verhuisde? Hoe dan ook is de tijd rijp om deze twee succesverhalen samen te brengen.</p><p>Toen Calefax zijn eerste schreden zette op de Nederlandse podia was De Meij nog trombonist, onder meer van Orkest de Volharding, in 1972 opgericht door onder anderen Louis Andriessen, Willem Breuker en Jan Wolff &ndash; laatstgenoemde werd later als directeur van De IJsbreker een sterkhouder van het jonge Calefax. Maar liefst twintig jaar speelde De Meij in in dit vermaarde gezelschap, en hij maakte van dichtbij grote veranderingen mee &ndash; van een politiek ge&euml;ngageerde band tot een gedirigeerd ensemble voor nieuwe muziek. Toen hij in 1988 bij de Volharding kwam legde De Meij juist de laatste hand aan wat zijn doorbraak als componist zou worden; zijn eerste symfonie &lsquo;The Lord of the Rings&rsquo; voor groot bezet harmonieorkest. De ruim driehonderd stukken die De Meij in zijn jaren met De Volharding in premi&egrave;re bracht hebben onmiskenbaar een stempel gedrukt op de verdere ontwikkeling van zijn compositorisch denken.&nbsp;</p><p>En nu, na vele rijpende jaren, ieder in zijn eigen muzikale universum, slaan De Meij en Calefax de handen ineen. De Meij werd door Calefax benaderd in 2017, op een voor hem persoonlijk lastig moment, namelijk kort nadat hij tijdens een onfortuinlijk ski-ongeluk zijn enkel had gebroken. Normaal gesproken reist De Meij van hot naar her om te dirigeren, meestal eigen werk, maar nu was hij maar liefst zes weken aan bed gekluisterd. Dat had wel &eacute;&eacute;n positieve bijkomstigheid, namelijk m&eacute;&eacute;r tijd om te componeren, en tijdens het eerste gesprek met Alban Wesley kwamen Cruijffiaanse kreten voorbij zoals &lsquo;<em>ieder nadeel hep se voordeel</em>&rsquo;. De Meij: &ldquo;die associatie met Johan Cruijff bleek een vruchtbare. Als we het over Cruijff hebben, dan spreken we in termen van virtuositeit, creativiteit, grilligheid en radicale vernieuwing. Dat zijn aspecten die ik ook bij Calefax zie, een groep die met zijn bezetting iets compleet nieuws heeft gebracht in de kamermuziek. Zo kwam ik ook tot mijn titel voor het stuk Un Momento Dado, een verwijzing naar de eigenzinnigheid &eacute;n bevlogenheid van Johan Cruijff. Deze woorden &lsquo;en un momento dado&rsquo; bezigde Cruijff in zijn Catalaanse jaren ooit tijdens een persconferentie, in zijn steenkolen-Spaans, de aanwezigen in verbazing achterlatend over de betekenis van deze Nederlandse uitdrukking die Cruijff wel erg letterlijk had vertaald. Maar het mooie is: de Spanjaarden vonden het zo&rsquo;n mooie uitdrukking dat die&nbsp;<em>stante pede&nbsp;</em>een plekje kreeg in het hedendaagse Spaans. En dit doet mij dus denken aan Calefax, een bevlogen groep die al 34 jaar onverstoorbaar en met een creatieve&nbsp;<em>drive&nbsp;</em>in de wereld van de kamermuziek een plek verovert voor zijn eigenzinnige bezetting.&rdquo;</p><p>Voor dit nieuwe werk koos De Meij, mede op aandringen van de musici van Calefax, voor een&nbsp;<em>Concerto Gross</em>o-achtige vorm, waarbij het rietkwintet en het harmonieorkest elkaar op vloeiende wijze afwisselen &eacute;n af en toe gezamenlijk optrekken. Tijdens de majesteitelijk orkestrale opening van twee minuten, met verwachtingsvol trompetgeschal en een opvallende rol voor de harp, is het muzikale uitgangspunt al hoorbaar, dat De Meij koos voor Un Momento Dado. Dit&nbsp;<em>Leitmotiv</em>&nbsp;bestaat uit de tonen C-A-E-F-A, zijnde de notennamen die als letters in het woord CALEFAX te vinden zijn. In zijn pure vorm klinkt dit motief voor het eerst als het rietkwintet ten tonele verschijnt, ge&iuml;ntroduceerd door de hobo. Wat volgt is een aaneenschakeling van muzikale invallen in een grote rijkdom aan kleurencombinaties. Opvallend hierbij zijn de momenten waar De Meij &eacute;&eacute;n van de instrumenten van Calefax paart aan een groep uit het orkest; een dromerige passage voor saxofonist Raaf Hekkema met de saxofoonsectie, en hobo&iuml;st Oliver Boekhoorn met de dubbelrietblazers van het orkest. Ook is er een moment waarbij Calefax wordt beantwoord door dezelfde vijf blazers uit het orkest, door De Meij gekscherend &ldquo;Shadowfax&rdquo; genoemd. Het motief C-A-E-F-A komt in vele gedaantes terug, uiteindelijk zelfs ook als citaat van Richard Strauss&rsquo; bekende Tijl Uilenspiegel-riedel waar het aan doet denken, alvorens in een virtuoze klank-cascade naar het triomferende eind te rennen.</p><p>&nbsp;Al jaren stelt Calefax zich ten doel om zijn repertoire ter beschikking te stellen aan andere rietkwintetten. Begin deze eeuw begon Calefax bladmuziek van zijn arrangementen uit te geven in de CALEFAX EDITION. Partituren en partijen zijn verkrijgbaar in de webshop van&nbsp;<a href=\"http://calefax.nl\">calefax.nl</a>, en worden vanuit de hele wereld besteld. Daarnaast breidt Calefax het repertoire van originele stukken voor rietkwintet uit door het geven van opdrachten &eacute;n door het organiseren van een jaarlijkse compositiewedstrijd. Inmiddels zijn er wereldwijd maar liefst veertig rietkwintetten te tellen, en dat aantal groeit gestaag door. Aan deze groei hoopt Calefax een nieuwe&nbsp;<em>boost&nbsp;</em>te geven door het betreden van de wereld van het harmonieorkest. Immers: in ieder harmonieorkest huist ook een rietkwintet!&nbsp;</p><p>De premi&egrave;re van Un Momento Dado, op 10 januari 2020 in Tilburg, wordt gedirigeerd door de chef-dirigent van de Marinierskapel, Arjan Tien.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p>",

Many orchestras are playing film scores to accompany Hollywood movies in order to reach a broader, younger audience. We offer a more sophisticated and contemporary approach: <em>The Planet Earth Film + Symphony experience.</em> This visually rich, 49-minute film takes audiences on a deep and uplifting journey from earth&rsquo;s creation to the present day as an accompaniment to a live performance of <em>Symphony No. 3</em> <em>Planet Earth</em> by award-winning composer, Johan de Meij.&nbsp; Written as a sequel to Gustav Holst&rsquo;s, <em>The Planets,</em> Symphony No. 3 <em>Planet Earth</em> tells the story of the planet Holst forgot to include&mdash;Earth. De Meij&rsquo;s symphony is an ode to Mother Earth and like Holst&rsquo;s work, employs a full symphony and female choir. Over the past 12 years, it has built a steady following across five continents</span></span></p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif;\"><em><span>&ldquo;</span>The film gives the orchestral score a whole new dimension.

Sitting down and putting those tiny dots on paper doesn&rsquo;t come difficult either. It is the interval between those two phases that most often takes up considerable time!<br /><br />The ignition to write a concert piece for the trombone&nbsp; happened in Copenhagen at the Tivoli Gardens concert hall in 1997. Attending rehearsals of my <em>Hans Christian Andersen Suite for Wind Orchestra</em>, I happened to be around for the rehearsal of Johan de Meij&rsquo;s inspiring <em>T-Bone Concerto </em>performed by the phenomenal Jesper Juul S&oslash;rensen. I was particularly struck by the merging of technical virtuosity and lyrical expression &ndash; and, first and last, how completely easy and effortlessly Jesper made it sound. He liked the flavour of my HCA Suite and invited me to compose a concert piece with him in mind. And here we are, some four years and many oeuvres later.<br /><br />With <em>Rapsodia Borealis</em> I had in mind a sort of circular structure centred around a truly lyrical, cantabile theme &ndash; a song of the North for the trombone (hence the title which means Rhapsody of the North). The orchestra is launched at full force but the soloist soon jumps on the carousel of semi-dissonant, kaleidoscopic and nearly minimalist chord progressions. Following a series of playful inventions, the trombone almost surprisingly takes the lead with its tuneful hymn, later to be joined by members of the orchestra in various permutations and arrangements. From the very start, the purpose of this concerto has not necessarily been to re-define the term<em> technically challenging</em> in context with the solo trombone; rather, it was as much my goal to emphasize the tender, lyrical side of the modern concert trombone.<br /><br />S&oslash;ren Hyldgaard<br />Copenhagen - October 2001</span></p>",
